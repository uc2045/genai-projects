(NASDAQ:NVDA) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\\nInsider Monkey Transcripts\\nThu, Feb 22, 2024, 10:58 AM 15 min read\\nIn This Article:\\nNVDA +0.90%\\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript February 21, 2024\\nNVIDIA Corporation beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $5.16, expectations were $4.54. NVDA isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\\nOperator: Good afternoon. My name is Rob and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.\\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024. With me today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\\nThese are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, February 21, 2024, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.\\nWith that let me turn the call over to Colette.\\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up to 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency.\\nStory Continues\\nAt the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions.\\nThe versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale, enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private clouds or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy.\\nIn the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases did. Consumer internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems.\\nThese AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-throughs rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. Early customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success.\\nServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP and Snowflake. The field of foundation of large-language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world many regions.\\nAnd others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate:Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers. Just this morning, we announced that we've collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud data center and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full stack accelerated computing platform.\\nWe estimate the data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions includes systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, creation, labeling and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. And in fact, nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly.\\n\\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\\nIn healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained Biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for their proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection.\\nFor example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions, except for China where our data center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4. And we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first-quarter. In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver.\\nCountries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large-language models in their own language, on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de-facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year on year.\\nNVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over ethernet, that are purpose built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Super Micro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter.\\nWe also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities.\\nSales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI tops, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating an everyday productivity. The rich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, seven out of eight pixels can be AI generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the Tensor RT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large-language models generative AI can run up to 5X faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEMs. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14 inch and thin and light laptops.\\nWith up to 686 tops of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms. At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed-base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way.\\nMoving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads, such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, automotive and robotics. The automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize work flows from design to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators.\\nLeading automakers like LOTUS are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers often -- offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year.\\nThere were several automotive customer announcements this quarter, Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Jeremy Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong data center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases.\\nLet me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in data center and proviz, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis-points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us.\\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community.

The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2026.\\nNon-GAAP Measures\\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\\n NVIDIA CORPORATION   CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME  (In millions, except per share

ACCOUNT\\n\\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presents the Nvidia Blackwell platform at an event ahead of the Computex forum, in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024.\\nAnn Wang | Reuters\\nNvidia reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations. The company also provided strong guidance for the current quarter.\\nThe company’s report and guidance signals that the chipmaker is confident it will be able to continue its historic run of growth driven by artificial intelligence well into 2025. Shares were flat in extended trading.\\nHere’s how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\\n\\nRevenue: $39.33 billion vs. $38.05 billion estimated\\nEarnings per share: 89 cents adjusted vs. 84 cents estimated\\n\\nNvidia said it expected about $43 billion in first-quarter revenue, plus or minus 2%, versus $41.78 billion expected per LSEG estimates. The first-quarter forecast implies year-to-year growth of about 65% from a year earlier, a slowdown from 262% annual growth in the same period a year prior.\\nChief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company expects “a significant ramp” of sales of Blackwell, its next-generation AI chip, in the first quarter.\\nNet income during the quarter rose to $22.09 billion, or 89 cents per diluted share, versus $12.29 billion, or 49 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\\nNvidia reported a 73% gross margin in the quarter, which was down three points on an annual basis. The company said the decline in gross margin was due to newer data center products that were more complicated and expensive.\\nRevenue continues to surge at Nvidia as the company rides the AI boom with its data center graphics processing units, or GPUs, which comprise the vast majority of the market for AI accelerators. Nvidia’s revenue in the quarter rose 78% from $35.1 billion, and full fiscal-year revenue for Nvidia rose 114% to $130.5 billion.\\nHowever, Nvidia’s growth is slowing as the company becomes larger. During the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2024, Nvidia sales more than tripled.\\nMuch of the focus this calendar year is on how quickly the company can ship its next-generation AI processors, called Blackwell.\\n\\nwatch now\\nVIDEO3:1503:15\\nNvidia beats on revenue and earnings, data center revenue beats\\nClosing Bell: Overtime\\nNvidia said it had $11 billion in Blackwell revenue during the fourth quarter. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Blackwell is “amazing” in a statement, and Kress called it “the fastest product ramp in our company’s history.”\\n“Blackwell sales were led by large cloud service providers which represented approximately 50% of our Data Center revenue,” Kress said in a statement.\\nBlackwell sales, as well as sales of the previous generation Hopper AI chips, are reported in the company’s data center business. That unit now represents 91% of the company’s total sales, up from 83% a year ago and 60% in the same period of 2023. In total, data center revenue has increased about tenfold over the past two years.\\nNvidia said it had $35.6 billion in data center revenue in the fourth quarter, which was up 93% on an annual basis. That also surpassed StreetAccount expectations of $33.65 billion.\\nNvidia officials told investors that while its chips were previously used to develop, or train, artificial intelligence, its new chips such as Blackwell would be used to deliver AI software, a process often called inference.\\nKress also addressed investor concerns that efficient models such as DeepSeek’s R1 may limit the need for additional Nvidia chips. New ways of running AI models that ask the AI to generate additional information to “think” through responses could require as much as 100 times the amount of Nvidia chips, she said.\\n“Long-thinking, reasoning AI can require 100 times more compute per task compared to one shot inferences,” Kress said.\\n“The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference,” Huang told investors. He said next-generation AI algorithms could even need millions of times the current amount of computing capacity.\\nHuang also addressed questions about whether Nvidia’s business could be threatened by custom chips being developed by technology companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\\n“Just because the chip is designed doesn’t mean it gets deployed,” Huang said.\\nThe company’s data center business this quarter also included $3 billion in sales for the company’s networking parts, which are used to connect hundreds of thousands of GPUs together. However, while Nvidia had signaled that networking was a growth opportunity for the company, networking sales were down 9% from a year ago.\\nThe company’s gaming business, which includes graphics processors for playing 3D games, reported $2.5 billion in sales versus StreetAccount expectations of $3.04 billion. Nvidia’s graphics sales actually declined 11% on an annual basis. The company announced new graphics cards for consumers during the quarter that share the same Blackwell architecture as the company’s AI chips.\\nOne of the company’s growth categories is its business selling chips for cars and robots. Nvidia said on Wednesday that it had $570 million in automotive sales during the quarter, which is a small fraction of the company’s AI business, but which represents a 103% rise on a year-over-year basis.\\nNvidia said it spent $33.7 billion on share repurchases in its fiscal 2025.\\nDon’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\\n\\nWhy Tesla’s stock is unraveling and what happens next, according to Barclays\\nHow to produce income from Nvidia while waiting for a rebound\\nHedge funds are buying more of these ‘rising star’ stocks, according to Goldman\\nThese S&P 500 stocks are deeply oversold and may be due for a rebound\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO\\n\\nSubscribe to Investing Club\\nLicensing & Reprints\\nCNBC Councils\\nSelect Personal Finance\\nCNBC on Peacock\\nJoin the CNBC Panel\\nSupply Chain Values\\nSelect Shopping\\nClosed Captioning\\nDigital Products\\nNews Releases\\nInternships\\nCorrections\\nAbout CNBC\\nAd Choices\\nSite Map\\nPodcasts\\nCareers\\nHelp\\n\\nContact\\n\\n\\nNews Tips\\nGot a confidential news tip?

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\\nThanks, Stewart. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up 12% sequentially and up 78% year on year and above our outlook of $37.5 billion. For fiscal 2025 revenue was $130.5 billion, up 114% from the prior year.\\nLet's start with Data Center. Data center revenue for fiscal 2025 was $115.2 billion, more than doubling from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $35.6 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and 93% year on year as the Blackwell ramp commenced and Hopper 200 continued sequential growth. In Q4, Blackwell sales exceeded our expectations.\\nWe delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale. Blackwell production is in full-year across multiple configurations, and we are increasing supply quickly expanding customer adoption. Our Q4 Data Center compute revenue jumped 18% sequentially and over 2x year on year.\\nCustomers are racing to scale infrastructure to train the next generation of cutting-edge models and unlock the next level of AI capabilities. With Blackwell, it will be common for these clusters to start with 100,000 GPUs or more. Shipments have already started for multiple infrastructures of this size. Post-training and model customization are fueling demand for NVIDIA infrastructure and software as developers and enterprises leverage techniques such as fine-tuning reinforcement learning and distillation to tailor models for domain-specific use cases.\\nHugging Face alone hosts over 90,000 derivatives freighted from the Llama foundation model. The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude, more compute than pretraining. Our inference demand is accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Grok 3. Long-thinking reasoning AI can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences.\\nBlackwell was architected for reasoning AI inference. Blackwell supercharges reasoning AI models with up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost versus Hopper 100. It is revolutionary transformer engine is built for LLM and mixture of experts inference. And its NVLink Domain delivers 14x the throughput of PCIe Gen 5, ensuring the response time, throughput, and cost efficiency needed to tackle the growing complexity of infants of scale.\\nCompanies across industries are tapping into NVIDIA's whole STAG inference platform to boost performance and slash costs. Now, tripled inference throughput and cut costs by 66%, using NVIDIA TensorRT for its screenshot feature. Perplexity sees 435 million monthly queries and reduced its inference costs 3x with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and TensorRT-LLM. Microsoft Bing achieved a 5x speed up at major TCO savings for visual search across billions of images with NVIDIA, TensorRT, and acceleration libraries.\\nBlackwell has great demand for inference. Many of the early GB200 deployments are earmarked for inference, a first for a new architecture. Blackwell addresses the entire AI market from pretraining, post-training to inference across cloud, to on-premise, to enterprise. CUDA's programmable architecture accelerates every AI model and over 4,400 applications, ensuring large infrastructure investments against obsolescence in rapidly evolving markets.\\nOur performance and pace of innovation is unmatched. We're driven to a 200x reduction in inference costs in just the last two years. We delivered the lowest TCO and the highest ROI. And full stack optimizations for NVIDIA and our large ecosystem, including 5.9 million developers continuously improve our customers' economics.\\nIn Q4, large CSPs represented about half of our data center revenue. and these sales increased nearly 2x year on year. Large CSPs were some of the first to stand up Blackwell with Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI bringing GB200 systems to cloud regions around the world to meet certain surging customer demand for AI. Regional cloud hosting NVIDIA GPUs increased as a percentage of data center revenue, reflecting continued AI factory build-outs globally and rapidly rising demand for AI reasoning models and agents.\\nWe've launched a 100,000 GB200 cluster-based incidents with NVLink Switch and Quantum 2 InfiniBand. Consumer Internet revenue grew 3x year on year, driven by an expanding set of generative AI and deep learning use cases. These include recommender systems, vision, language understanding, synthetic data generation search, and agentic AI. For example, xAI is adopting the GB200 to train and inference its next generation of Grok AI models.\\nMeta's cutting-edge Andromeda advertising engine runs on NVIDIA's Grace Hopper Superchip serving vast quantities of ads across Instagram, Facebook applications. Andromeda harnesses Grace Hopper's fast interconnect and large memory to boost inference throughput by 3x, enhance ad personalization, and deliver meaningful jumps in monetization and ROI. Enterprise revenue increased nearly 2x year on accelerating demand for model fine-tuning, RAG, and agentic AI workflows, and GPU-accelerated data processing. We introduced NVIDIA Llama Nemotron model family NIMs to help developers create and deploy AI agents across a range of applications including customer support, fraud detection, and product supply chain and inventory management.\\nLeading AI agent platform providers, including SAP and ServiceNow, are among the first to use new models. Health care leaders IQVIA, Illumina, Mayo Clinic, and Arc Institute are using NVIDIA AI to speed drug discovery enhanced genomic research and Pioneer advanced healthcare services with generative and agentic AI. As AI expands beyond the digital world, NVIDIA infrastructure and software platforms are increasingly being adopted to power robotics and physical AI development. One of the early and largest robotics applications and autonomous vehicles where virtually, every AV company is developing on NVIDIA in the data center, the car, or both.\\nNVIDIA's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year. At CES, Hyundai Motor Group announced it is adopting NVIDIA technologies to accelerate AV and robotics development and smart factory initiatives. Vision transformers, self-supervised learning, multimodal sensor fusion, and high-fidelity simulation are driving breakthroughs in AV development and will require 10x more compute. At CES, we announced the NVIDIA COSMO World Foundation model platform.\\nJust as language, foundation models have revolutionized Language AI, Cosmos is a physical AI to revolutionize robotics. The robotics and automotive companies, including ridesharing giant Uber, are among the first to adopt the platform. From a geographic perspective, sequential growth in our Data Center revenue was strongest in the U.S., driven by the initial ramp up Blackwell. Countries across the globe are building their AI ecosystem as demand for compute infrastructure is surging.\\nFrance's EUR 100 billion AI investment and the EU's EUR 200 billion invest AI initiatives offer a glimpse into the build-out to set redefined global AI infrastructure in the coming years. Now, as a percentage of total Data Center revenue, data center sales in China remained well below levels seen on the onset of export controls. Absent any change in regulations, we believe that China shipments will remain roughly at the current percentage. The market in China for data center solutions remains very competitive.\\nWe will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Networking revenue declined 3% sequentially. Our networking attached to GPU compute systems is robust at over 75%. We are transitioning from small NVLink 8 with InfiniBand, to large NVLink 72 with Spectrum-X.\\nSpectrum-X and NVLink Switch revenue increased and represents a major new growth vector. We expect networking to return to growth in Q1. AI requires a new class of networking. NVIDIA offers NVLink Switch systems for scale-up compute.\\nFor scale-out, we offer quantum incentive for HPC supercomputers and Spectrum X for Ethernet environments. Spectrum-X enhances the Ethernet for AI computing and has been a huge success. Microsoft Azure, OCI, CoreWeave, and others are building large AI factories with Spectrum-X. The first Stargate data centers will use Spectrum-X.\\nYesterday, Cisco announced integrating Spectrum-X into their networking portfolio to help enterprises build AI infrastructure. With its large enterprise footprint and global reach, Cisco will bring NVIDIA Ethernet to every industry. Now, moving to gaming and ARPCs. Gaming revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 22% sequentially and 11% year on year.\\nFull-year revenue of $11.4 billion increased 9% year on year, and demand remains strong throughout the holiday. However, Q4 shipments were impacted by supply constraints. We expect strong sequential growth in Q1 as supply increases. The new GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs are here.\\nBuild for gamers, creators, and developers they fuse AI and graphics redefining visual computing, powered by the Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor cores, and fourth-generation RT cores and featuring UQ's400AI tops. These GPUs deliver a 2x performance leap and new AI-driven rendering including neuro shaders, digital human technologies, geometry, and lighting. The new DLSS 4 boost frame rates up to 8x with AI-driven frame generation, turning one rendered frame into three. It also features the industry's first real-time application of transformer models packing 2x more parameters and 4x to compute for unprecedented visual fidelity.\\nWe also announced a wave of GeForce Blackwell laptop GPUs with new NVIDIA Max-Q technology that extends battery life by up to an incredible 40%. These laptops will be available starting in March from the world's top manufacturers. Moving to our professional visualization business. Revenue of $511 million was up 5% sequentially and 10% year on year.\\nFull-year revenue of $1.9 billion increased 21% year on year. Key industry verticals driving demand include automotive and healthcare. NVIDIA Technologies and generative AI are reshaping design, engineering, and simulation workloads. Increasingly, these technologies are being leveraged in leading software platforms from ANSYS, Cadence, and Siemens fueling demand for NVIDIA RTX workstations.\\nNow, moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $570 million, up 27% sequentially and up 103% year on year. Full-year revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% year on year. Strong growth was driven by the continued ramp in autonomous vehicles, including cars and robotaxis.\\nAt CES, we announced Toyota, the world's largest automaker will build its next-generation vehicles on NVIDIA Orin running the safety-certified NVIDIA DriveOS. We announced Aurora and Continental will deploy driverless trucks at scale powered by NVIDIA Drive Thor. Finally, our end-to-end autonomous vehicle platform NVIDIA Drive Hyperion has passed industry safety assessments like TUV SUD and TUV Rheinland, two of the industry's foremost authorities for automotive-grade safety and cybersecurity. NVIDIA is the first AV platform that received a comprehensive set of third-party assessments.\\nOK. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 73% and non-GAAP gross margin was 73.5% and down sequentially as expected with our first deliveries of the Blackwell architecture. As discussed last quarter, Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA build chips multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data center.\\nWe exceeded our expectations in Q4 in ramping Blackwell, increasing system availability, providing several configurations to our customers. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to be in the low 70s. Initially, we are focused on expediting the manufacturing of Blackwell systems to meet strong customer demand as they race to build out Blackwell infrastructure. When fully ramped, we have many opportunities to improve the cost, and gross margin will improve and return to the mid-70s, late this fiscal year.\\nSequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 9% and non-GAAP operating expenses were 11%, reflecting higher engineering development costs and higher compute and infrastructure costs for new product introductions. In Q4, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Let me turn to the outlook in the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $43 billion, plus or minus 2%.\\nContinuing with its strong demand, we expect a significant ramp of Blackwell in Q1. We expect sequential growth in both Data Center and Gaming. Within Data Center, we expect sequential growth from both compute and networking. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 70.6% and 71%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.\\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. We expect full-year fiscal year '26 operating expenses to grow to be in the mid-30s. GAAP and non-GAAP other incoming expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million. excluding gains and losses from nonmarketable and publicly held equity securities.\\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website, including a new financial information AI agent. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the TD Cowen Health Care Conference in Boston on March 3 and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 5.\\nPlease join us for our Annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 17 in San Jose, California. Jensen will deliver a news-packed keynote on March 18, and we will host a Q&A session for our financial analysts for the next day, March 19. We look forward to seeing you at these events. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for May 28, 2025.\\nWe are going to open up the call, operator, to questions. If you could start that, that would be great.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess for me, Jensen, as test-time compute and reinforcement learning shows such promise, we're clearly seeing an increasing blurring of the lines between training and inference.\\nWhat does this mean for the potential future of potentially inference dedicated clusters? And how do you think about the overall impact to NVIDIA and your customers? Thank you.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, I appreciate that, C.J. There are now multiple scaling laws. There's the pre-training scaling law, and that's going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is post-training skilling, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards.\\nThe amount of computation you use for post-training is actually higher than pretraining. And it's kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you're using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post-trade.\\nAnd the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is test-time compute or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling. They're all basically the same ideas. And there, you have a chain of thought, you have search. The amount of tokens generated the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning.\\nAnd that's just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even, hopefully, extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today is in our future. And so, the question is, how do you design such an architecture? Some of it -- some of the models are auto-regressive.\\nSome of the models are diffusion-based. Some of it -- some of the times you want your data center to have disaggregated inference. Sometimes, it is compacted. And so, it's hard to figure out what is the best configuration of a data center, which is the reason why NVIDIA's architecture is so popular.\\nWe run every model. We are great at training. The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference and Blackwell takes all of that to a new level. We designed Blackwell with the idea of reasoning models in mind.\\nAnd when you look at training, it's many times more performing. But what's really amazing is for long thinking test time scaling, reasoning AI models were tens of times faster, 25x higher throughput. And so, Blackwell is going to be incredible across the board. And when you have a data center that allows you to configure and use your data center based on are you doing more pretraining now, post-training now, or scaling out your inference, our architecture is fungible and easy to use in all of those different ways.\\nAnd so, we're seeing, in fact, much, much more concentration of a unified architecture than ever before.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nJoe Moore -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\nMorgan Stanley, actually. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about GB200 at CES, you sort of talked about the complexity of the rack-level systems and the challenges you have. And then as you said in the prepared remarks, we've seen a lot of general availability.\\nWhere are you in terms of that ramp? Are there still bottlenecks to consider at a systems level above and beyond the chip level? And just have you maintained your enthusiasm for the NVL72 platforms?\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, I'm more enthusiastic today than I was at CES. And the reason for that is because we've shipped a lot more since CES. We have some 350 plants manufacturing the 1.5 million components that go into each one of the Blackwell racks, Grace Blackwell racks. Yes, it's extremely complicated.\\nAnd we successfully and incredibly ramped up Grace Blackwell, delivering some $11 billion of revenues last quarter. We're going to have to continue to scale as demand is quite high, and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems. You've probably seen on the web, a fair number of celebrations about Grace Blackwell systems coming online and we have them, of course. We have a fairly large installation of Grace Blackwell for our own engineering and our own design teams and software teams.\\nCoreWeave has now been quite public about the successful bring-up of theirs. Microsoft has, of course, OpenAI has, and you're starting to see many come online. And so, I think the answer to your question is nothing is easy about what we're doing, but we're doing great, and all of our partners are doing great.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\\nVivek Arya -- Analyst\\nThank you for taking my question. Colette if you wouldn't mind confirming if Q1 is the bottom for gross margins? And then Jensen, my question is for you. What is on your dashboard to give you the confidence that the strong demand can sustain into next year? And has DeepSeek and whatever innovations they came up with, has that changed that view in any way? Thank you.\\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\\nWell, let me first take the first part of the question there regarding the gross margin. During our Blackwell ramp, our gross margins will be in the low 70s. At this point, we are focusing on expediting our manufacturing, expediting our manufacturing to make sure that we can provide to customers as soon as possible. Our Blackwell is fully round.\\nAnd once it does -- I'm sorry, once our Blackwell fully rounds, we can improve our cost and our gross margin. So, we expect to probably be in the mid-70s later this year. Walking through what you heard Jensen speak about the systems and their complexity, they are customizable in some cases. They've got multiple networking options.\\nThey have liquid-cooled and water-cooled. So, we know there is an opportunity for us to improve these gross margins going forward. But right now, we are going to focus on getting the manufacturing complete and to our customers as soon as possible.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe know several things, Vivek. We have a fairly good line of sight of the amount of capital investment that data centers are building out toward. We know that going forward, the vast majority of software is going to be based on machine learning. And so, accelerated computing and generative AI, reasoning AI are going to be the type of architecture you want in your data center.\\nWe have, of course, forecasts and plans from our top partners. And we also know that there are many innovative, really exciting start-ups that are still coming online as new opportunities for developing the next breakthroughs in AI, whether it's agentic AIs, reasoning AI, or physical AIs. The number of start-ups are still quite vibrant and each one of them needs a fair amount of computing infrastructure. And so, I think the -- whether it's the near-term signals or the midterm signals, near-term signals, of course, are POs and forecasts and things like that.\\nMidterm signals would be the level of infrastructure and capex scale-out compared to previous years. And then the long-term signals has to do with the fact that we know fundamentally software has changed from hand-coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning and AI-based software that runs on GPUs and accelerated computing systems. And so, we have a fairly good sense that this is the future of software. And then maybe as you roll it out, another way to think about that is we've really only tapped consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI, advertising, recommenders, kind of the early days of software.\\nThe next wave is coming, agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics, and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI for their own ecosystems. And so, each one of these are barely off the ground, and we can see them. We can see them because, obviously, we're in the center of much of this development and we can see great activity happening in all these different places and these will happen. So, near term, midterm, long term.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nHarlan Sur -- Analyst\\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Your next-generation Blackwell Ultra is set to launch in the second half of this year, in line with the team's annual product cadence.\\nJensen, can you help us understand the demand dynamics for Ultra given that you'll still be ramping the current generation Blackwell solutions? How do your customers and the supply chain also manage the simultaneous ramps of these two products? And is the team still on track to execute Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year?\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Blackwell Ultra is second half. As you know, the first Blackwell was we had a hiccup that probably cost us a couple of months. We're fully recovered, of course.\\nThe team did an amazing job recovering and all of our supply chain partners and just so many people helped us recover at the speed of light. And so, now we've successfully ramped production of Blackwell. But that doesn't stop the next train. The next train is on an annual rhythm and Blackwell Ultra with new networking, new memories, and of course, new processors, and all of that is coming online.\\nWe have been working with all of our partners and customers, laying this out. They have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everybody to do the proper transition. This time between Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because we went from an NVLink 8 system to an NVLink 72-based system.\\nSo, the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition. But the next transition will slot right in Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners on the click after that.\\nAnd the click after that is called Vera Rubin and all of our partners are getting up to speed on the transition of that and so preparing for that transition. And again, we're going to provide a big, huge step-up. And so, come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin and then show you what we place after that. Really exciting new products to come to GTC piece.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\\nThanks a lot. Jensen, we heard a lot about custom ASICs. Can you kind of speak to the balance between customer ASIC and merchant GPU? We hear about some of these heterogeneous superclusters to use both GPU and ASIC. Is that something customers are planning on building? Or will these infrastructures remain fairly distinct? Thanks.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, we built very different things than ASICs, in some ways, completely different in some areas we intercept. We're different in several ways. One, NVIDIA'S architecture is general whether you're -- you've optimized for unaggressive models or diffusion-based models or vision-based models or multimodal models, or text models. We're great in all of it.\\nWe're great on all of it because our software stack is so -- our architecture is sensible. Our software stack ecosystem is so rich that we're the initial target of most exciting innovations and algorithms. And so, by definition, we're much, much more general than narrow. We're also really good from the end-to-end from data processing, the curation of the training data, to the training of the data, of course, to reinforcement learning used in post-training, all the way to inference with tough time scaling.\\nSo, we're general, we're end-to-end, and we're everywhere. And because we're not in just one cloud, we're in every cloud, we could be on-prem. We could be in a robot. Our architecture is much more accessible and a great target initial target for anybody who's starting up a new company.\\nAnd so, we're everywhere. And the third thing I would say is that our performance in our rhythm is so incredibly fast. Remember that these data centers are always fixed in size. They're fixed in size or they're fixing power.\\nAnd if our performance per watt is anywhere from 2x to 4x to 8x, which is not unusual, it translates directly to revenues. And so, if you have a 100-megawatt data center, if the performance or the throughput in that 100-megawatt or the gigawatt data center is four times or eight times higher, your revenues for that gigawatt data center is eight times higher. And the reason that is so different than data centers of the past is because AI factories are directly monetizable through its tokens generated. And so, the token throughput of our architecture being so incredibly fast is just incredibly valuable to all of the companies that are building these things for revenue generation reasons and capturing the fast ROI.\\nAnd so, I think the third reason is performance. And then the last thing that I would say is the software stack is incredibly hard. Building an ASIC is no different than what we do. We build a new architecture.\\nAnd the ecosystem that sits on top of our architecture is 10 times more complex today than it was two years ago. And that's fairly obvious because the amount of software that the world is building on top of architecture is growing exponentially and AI is advancing very quickly. So, bringing that whole ecosystem on top of multiple chips is hard. And so, I would say that -- those four reasons.\\nAnd then finally, I will say this, just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again. There are a lot of chips that get built, but when the time comes, a business decision has to be made, and that business decision is about deploying a new engine, a new processor into a limited AI factory in size, in power, and in fine. And our technology is not only more advanced, more performance, it has much, much better software capability and very importantly, our ability to deploy is lightning fast.\\nAnd so, these things are enough for the faint of heart, as everybody knows now. And so, there's a lot of different reasons why we do well, why we win.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\\nBen Reitzes -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hi. Ben Reitzes here. Hey, thanks a lot for the question.\\nJensen, it's a geography-related question. You did a great job explaining some of the demand underlying factors here on the strength. But U.S. was up about $5 billion or so sequentially.\\nAnd I think there is a concern about whether U.S. can pick up the slack if there's regulations toward other geographies. And I was just wondering, as we go throughout the year, if this kind of surge in the U.S. continues and it's going to be -- whether that's OK.\\nAnd if that underlies your growth rate, how can you keep growing so fast with this mix shift toward the U.S.? Your guidance looks like China is probably up sequentially. So, just wondering if you could go through that dynamic and maybe collect can weigh in. Thanks a lot.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nChina is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters. It's about half of what it was before the export control. But it's approximately the same in percentage. With respect to geographies, the takeaway is that AI is software.\\nIt's modern software. It's incredible modern software, but it's modern software and AI has gone mainstream. AI is used in delivery services everywhere, shopping services everywhere. If you were to buy a quart of milk, it's delivered to you.\\nAI was involved. And so almost everything that a consumer service provides AIs at the core of it. Every student will use AI as a tutor, healthcare services use AI, financial services use AI. No fintech company will not use AI.\\nEvery Fintech company will. Climate tech companies use AI. Mineral discovery now uses AI. The number of -- every higher education, every university uses AI and so I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream and that it's being integrated into every application.\\nAnd our hope is that, of course, the technology continues to advance safely and advance in a helpful way to society. And with that, we're -- I do believe that we're at the beginning of this new transition. And what I mean by that in the beginning is, remember, behind us has been decades of data centers and decades of computers that have been built. And they've been built for a world of hand coding and general-purpose computing and CPUs and so on and so forth.\\nAnd going forward, I think it's fairly safe to say that world is going to be almost all software to be infused with AI. All software and all services will be based on -- ultimately, based on machine learning, the data flywheel is going to be part of improving software and services and that the future computers will be accelerated, the future computers will be based on AI. And we're really two years into that journey. And in modernizing computers that have taken decades to build out.\\nAnd so, I'm fairly sure that we're in the beginning of this new era. And then lastly, no technology has ever had the opportunity to address a larger part of the world's GDP than AI. No software tool ever has. And so, this is now a software tool that can address a much larger part of the world's GDP more than any time in history.\\nAnd so, the way we think about growth, and the way we think about whether something is big or small has to be in the context of that. And when you take a step back and look at it from that perspective, we're really just in the beginning.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron, your line is open. Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nMark Lipacis -- Analyst\\nHi. It's Mark. Thanks for taking the question. I had a clarification and a question.\\nColette up for the clarification. Did you say that enterprise within the data center grew 2x year on year for the January quarter? And if so, does that -- would that make it the fast faster growing than the hyperscalers? And then, Jensen, for you, the question, hyperscalers are the biggest purchasers of your solutions, but they buy equipment for both internal and external workloads, external workflows being cloud services that enterprise is used. So, the question is, can you give us a sense of how that hyperscaler spend splits between that external workload and internal? And as these new AI workflows and applications come up, would you expect enterprises to become a larger part of that consumption mix? And does that impact how you develop your service, your ecosystem? Thank you.\\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\\nSure. Thanks for the question regarding our Enterprise business. Yes, it grew 2x and very similar to what we were seeing with our large CSPs. Keep in mind, these are both important areas to understand.\\nWorking with the CSPs can be working on large language models, can be working on inference in their own work. But keep in mind, that is also where the enterprises are servicing. Your enterprises are both with your CSPs as well as in terms of building on their own. They're both growing quite well.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThe CSPs are about half of our business. And the CSPs have internal consumption and external consumption, as you say. And we're using -- of course, used for internal consumption. We work very closely with all of them to optimize workloads that are internal to them because they have a large infrastructure of NVIDIA gear that they could take advantage of.\\nAnd the fact that we could be used for AI on the one hand, video processing on the other hand, data processing like Spark, we're fungible. And so, the useful life of our infrastructure is much better. If the useful life is much longer, then the TCO is also lower. And so, the second part is how do we see the growth of enterprise or not CSPs, if you will, going forward? And the answer is, I believe, long term, it is by far larger and the reason for that is because if you look at the computer industry today and what is not served by the computer industry is largely industrial.\\nSo, let me give you an example. When we say enterprise, and let's use the car company as an example because they make both soft things and hard things. And so, in the case of a car company, the employees will be what we call enterprise and agentic AI and software planning systems and tools, and we have some really exciting things to share with you guys at GTC, build agentic systems are for employees to make employees more productive to design to market plan to operate their company. That's agentic AI.\\nOn the other hand, the cars that they manufacture also need AI. They need an AI system that trains the cars, treats this entire giant fleet of cars. And today, there's 1 billion cars on the road. Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars, and they'll all be collecting data, and we'll be improving them using an AI factory.\\nWhereas they have a car factory today, in the future, they'll have a car factory and an AI factory. And then inside the car itself is a robotic system. And so, as you can see, there are three computers involved and there's the computer that helps the people. There's the computer that build the AI for the machineries that could be, of course, could be a tractor, it could be a lawn mower.\\nIt could be a human or robot that's being developed today. It could be a building. It could be a warehouse. These physical systems require new type of AI we call physical AI.\\nThey can't just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence, and cause and effect. And all of those type of things that are common sense to you and I, but AIs have to go learn those physical effects. So, we call that physical AI. That whole part of using agentic AI to revolutionize the way we work inside companies, that's just starting.\\nThis is now the beginning of the agentic AI era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it, and we got some really great things going on. And then there's the physical AI after that, and then there are robotic systems after that. And so, these three computers are all brand new. And my sense is that long term, this will be by far the larger of a mall, which kind of makes sense.\\nThe world's GDP is representing -- represented by either heavy industries or industrials and companies that are providing for those.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\\nYeah. Thanks for letting me back in. Jensen, I'm curious as we now approach the two-year anniversary of really the Hopper inflection that you saw in 2023 in GenAI in general. And when we think about the road map you have in front of us, how do you think about the infrastructure that's been deployed from a replacement cycle perspective and whether if it's GB300 or if it's the Rubin cycle where we start to see maybe some refresh opportunity? I'm just curious how you look at that.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I appreciate it. First of all, people are still using Voltas and Pascals, and Amperes. And the reason for that is because there are always things that because CUDA is so programmable you could use it Blackwell, one of the major use cases right now is data processing and data curation.\\nYou find a circumstance that an AI model is not very good at. You present that circumstance to a vision language model, let's say, it's a car. You present that circumstance to a vision language model. The vision language model actually looks in the circumstances, said, this is what happened and I was very good at it.\\nYou then take that response to the prompt, and you go and prompt an AI model to go find in your whole lake of data other circumstances like that, whatever that circumstance was. And then you use an AI to do domain randomization and generate a whole bunch of other examples. And then from that, you can go train the bottle. And so, you could use an peers to go and do data processing and data curation and machine learning-based search.\\nAnd then you create the training data set, which you then present to your Hopper systems for training. And so, each one of these architectures are completely -- they're all CUDA-compatible and so everything wants on everything. But if you have infrastructure in place, then you can put the less intensive workloads onto the installed base of the past. All of us are very well employed.\\nOperator\\nWe have time for one more question, and that question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\\nAtif Malik -- Analyst\\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on gross margins for Colette. So, I understand there are many moving parts the Blackwell yields, NVLink 72, and Ethernet mix.\\nAnd you kind of tipped to the earlier question the April quarter is the bottom, but second half would have to ramp like 200 basis points per quarter to get to the mid-70s range that you're giving for the end of the fiscal year. And we still don't know much about tariff impact to broader semiconductor, so what kind of gives you the confidence in that trajectory in the back half of this year?\\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Our gross margins, they're quite complex in terms of the material and everything that we put together in a Blackwell system, a tremendous amount of opportunity to look at a lot of different pieces of that on how we can better improve our gross margins over time. Remember, we have many different configurations as well on Blackwell that will be able to help us do that.\\nSo, together, working after we get some of these really strong ramping completed for our customers, we can begin a lot of that work. If not, we're going to probably start as soon as possible if we can. If we can improve it in the short term, we will also do that. Tariff at this point, it's a little bit of an unknown it's an unknown until we understand further what the U.S.\\ngovernment's plan is, both its timing, it's where, and how much. So, at this time, we are awaiting, but again, we would, of course, always follow export controls and/or tariffs in that manner.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'm sorry.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\\nWe are going to open up to Jensen. A couple of things.\\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nI just wanted to thank you. Thank you, Colette. The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning.\\nWith resenting AI, we're observing another scaling law, inference time or test time scaling, more computation. The more the model thinks the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAI, Grok 3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute.\\nFuture reasoning models can consume much more compute. DeepSeek-R1 has ignited global enthusiasm. It's an excellent innovation. But even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model.\\nNearly every AI developer is applying R1 or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques like R1 to scale their model's performance. We now have three scaling laws, as I mentioned earlier, driving the demand for AI computing. The traditional scaling loss of AI remains intact. Foundation models are being enhanced with multimodality, and pretraining is still growing.\\nBut it's no longer enough. We have two additional scaling dimensions: post-training scaling, where reinforcement learning, fine-tuning, model distillation require orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining alone; inference time scaling and reasoning where a single query and demand 100x more compute. We defined Blackwell for this moment, a single platform that can easily transition from pre-trading, post-training, and test time scaling. Blackwell's FP4 transformer engine and NVLink 72 scale-up fabric and new software technologies led Blackwell process reasoning AI models 25 times faster than Hopper.\\nBlackwell in all of this configuration is in full production. Each Grace Blackwell NVLink 72 rack is an engineering marvel. 1.5 million components produced across 350 manufacturing sites by nearly 100,000 factory operators. AI is advancing at light speed.\\nWe're at the beginning of reasoning AI and inference time scaling. But we're just at the start of the age of AI, multimodal AIs, enterprise AI sovereign AI and physical AI are right around the corner. We will grow strongly in 2025. Going forward, data centers will dedicate most of capex to accelerated computing and AI.\\nData centers will increasingly become AI factories, and every company will have either rented or self-operated. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Come join us at GTC in a couple of weeks. We're going to be talking about Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and other new computing, networking, reasoning AI, physical AI products, and a whole bunch more.\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\nDuration: 0 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nStewart Stecker -- Senior Director, Investor Relations\\nColette M.

The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025.\\nNon-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025.\\nNon-GAAP Measures\\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\\nAbout NVIDIA\\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue simply press star11 again as a reminder today's program is being recorded and now at i' like to introduce your host for today's program Mr John Pitzer corporate vice president vest relations please go ahead thank you Jonathan and good afternoon to everyone joining us today by now you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation both of which are available on our investor relations website inc.com for those joining us online today the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window I'm joined today by our inm Co CEO Michelle Johnson Holt house and Dave zinner as you know Michelle is also CEO of Intel products and Dave continues to serve as Intel CFO in a few moments Michelle will open up with some summary comments before providing more detail on Intel products Dave will then discuss Intel Foundry and the overall financials including our q1 guidance before we begin please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties it also contains references to non-gaap financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors our earnings release most recent annual report on form 10K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations they also provide additional information on our non-gaap fincial measures including reconciliations were appropriate to our corresponding Gap Financial measures with that let me turn things over to Michelle thank you John and let me add my welcome it's been roughly two months since Dave and I stepped into our roles as interim co-ceos from day one we had been working closely together alongside the board to drive better execution of our strategy there are no quick fixes and we are committed to improving our performance and rebuilding our credibility through persistent hard work that delivers tangible results as part of this we are driving more focused Investments across the business we cannot be all things to all people and we are prioritizing areas where we can drive differentiated value we are also continuing to simplify our business and become a leaner more efficient company and most of all we are doing a better job of listening to our customers to ensure we meet their needs Q4 was a step in the right direction we delivered Revenue gross margin and EPS above our guide Intel products executed to drive Revenue in the quarter even as PC inventory continued to normalize and Intel Foundry drove incremental operating efficiencies while achieving key Grant related Milestones which supported solid upside to gross margins as co-ceos you can expect us to be very straightforward and direct we only make commitments we are confident we can deliver we firmly believe that what we say is not nearly as important as what we do and everything we do must be in service of our customers innovating to solve their most pressing challenges is the shest path to creating shareholder value this is the mindset I have brought to my position as the CEO of Intel products this is a great business with great people partners and IP to design worldclass products from Edge to Cloud I take nothing for granted but I firmly believe that the core x86 architecture and the ecosystems we have built and invested in over the decades create a solid foundation for Success our customers share this view but they need us to improve our execution and hit our commitments I am setting clear priorities and directions in each business to drive better outcomes I think about Intel products in three buckets first client Edge second traditional Data Center and third the AI data center let me spend a few moments on each in client Intel CPUs power roughly seven out of every 10 PCS this is a strong position that gives us advantages in the market that said the market is becoming more competitive especially as we see new entrance trying to participate in the AIP category personally I thrive on competition it drives a healthy paranoia across everything we do and we're using it as motivation to up our game even more the success of core Ultra across meteor Lake AOL Lake and lunar lake has established Intel as the market leader in aipc CPUs and we remain on track to ship more than a 100 million cumulative systems by the end of 2025 we are inov in at scale unlike any of our competitors this was on display earlier this month at CES where we launched the Enterprise versions of our AIC CPUs with compelling new features to Intel vpro this is a testament to the strong ecosystem we have built with it departments around manageability security trust and brand and we expect these Investments to possession us well as corporations begin their migration to Windows 11 along onside our investments in Enterprise our ecosystem reach also positions us well in the aipc consumer markets we are working with more than 200 isvs across more than 400 features to optimize their software on our silicon I'm excited about the new applications I'm seeing in the pipeline that will begin to proliferate over the coming months our goal is to innovate partner and fortify our position as the preferred CPU of choice looking ahead to the rest of the year we will strengthen our client road mapap with the launch of Panther Lake our lead product on Intel 18a in the second half of 2025 as the first volume customer of Intel 18a I see the progress that Intel foundary is making on performance and yields and I look forward to being in production in the second half as we demonstrate the benefits of our world-class design and process technology capabilities 2026 is even more more exciting from a client perspective as Panther Lake achieves meaningful volumes and we introduce our next Generation client Family Code named Nova Lake both will provide strong performance across the entire PC stack with significantly better costs and margins for us enhancing our competitive position and reinforcing our value proposition to our partners and customers let me now turn to our traditional Data Center business the team has made good progress toward toward strengthening our offerings and driving better more predictable execution this year is all about improving zeon's competitive position as we fight harder to close the gap to competition the ramp of granite Rapids has been a good first step we are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest our first Intel 18a server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year all of this provides a strong foundation on which to build as we execute the world's data center workloads still primarily run on Intel silicon and we have a strong ecosystem especially within Enterprise we are going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025 one of the ways we'll do this is by re-engaging the x86 ecosystem we have seen a positive response from the x86 ecosystem Advisory Group we formed last fall and we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for building both semi-custom and custom products this is a big area of opportunity for the business and we look forward to talking more about this as we have news to share turning to the AI data center I will start by saying that this is an attractive market for us over time but I am not happy with where we are today on the one hand we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers and we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU based inference on Prem and at the end Edge as AI infused applications proliferate on the other hand we're not yet participating in the cloud-based AI Data Center Market in a meaningful way we have learned a lot as we have ramped gouty and we are applying those learnings going forward one of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our road map and concentrate our resources many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month based on industry feedback we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to Market this will support our efforts to develop a system level solution at Rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center more broadly as I think about our AI opportunity my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve most notably the need to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute AI is not a market in the traditional sense it's an enabling application that needs to span across the compute continuum from data center to the edge as such a one siiz fits-all approach will not work and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core Assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the Continuum before I turn the call over to Dave let me close by speaking as Intel foundry's largest wafer customer I have a pretty simple approach when we are able to combine worldclass products with worldclass process technology we win as as CEO of Intel products I will always make processed technology decisions based on what is best for my customers an Intel foundary will need to earn my business every day just as I need to earn the business of my customers having said that I'm confident in Intel foundaries team ability to support my current and future product roadmap and I'm excited to do more business with them as their process technology continues to advance a stronger Intel products combined with a more competitive Intel family is a recipe for success for Intel overall Dave over to you thanks Michelle let me add my welcome I'm going to address three topics today update on Intel Foundry second Q4 and full year financials and third our q1 guidance starting with Intel Foundry I've had an opportunity to meet with a number of our partners and potential customers for Intel Foundry over the last couple months I come away from those meetings encouraged by the opportunity we have in front of us and I've received clear feedback on what our customers need from us to succeed this starts with our execution on Intel ATA this has been an area of good progress like any new process there have been puts and takes along the way but overall we're confident that we are delivering a competitive process we're excited by the launch of Panther Lake this year and the internal ramp of Intel 18a in the second half that will support increased volumes and improved profitability in 2026 from the perspective of external customers Intel 18a is a very competitive offering that gives each of them a reason to engage with us however Foundry winds are about more than just technology trust is also a significant factor customers must believe you can execute consistently and be willing to invest in IP to Port a design to a new Foundry that's why past transitions in the industry have generally started with customers giving new Foundry Partners smaller volumes then gradually increasing as trust grows we've made good progress but to accelerate this I'm asking the team to redouble their efforts on ease of porting IP availability and best known Foundry methods I'm particularly pleased by the willingness of our suppliers and partners to engage with us augmenting our expertise and hard work with theirs job number one is earning the customer trust the Intel 18a design wins to date provide good validation of the strategy and we continue to have a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers but we won't win every deal out of the gates we'll be selective and focused on areas where we are confident that we can be a meaningful contributor to the success of our customer and we look forward to updating you as rfqs become wins in addition we continue to have good momentum in advanced packaging and in our collaboration with Tower semiconductor and UMC all three are critical to utilize our assets longer for higher rates of return this is a good segue into my other key areas of focus for Intel Foundry improving our financials and making sure that we're deploying your Capital appropriately at roughly 181 billion in Revenue Intel Foundry today is larger than all but one external Foundry that's clearly not reflected on our p&l with negative gross margins and a greater than $1 13 billion operating loss in 2024 we're going to systematically attack our costs and remain highly focused on our goal of delivering Break Even operating income for Intel Foundry by the end of 2027 and we expect to demonstrate improvements this year the financial benefits of Shifting our wafer volume from Intel 7 to Intel 18a along with learning to run our Fabs more efficiently and our process nodes longer will be important drivers of improving our financials Beyond 2027 we need to drive to cash flow from operations that supports our Capital spending needs and ultimately generate a great return on your capital I remain very optimistic on our opportunity in at Intel Foundry the pervasive growth of AI is driving accelerating and unprecedented demand for silicon and there continues to be an unmet need for greater choice and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry today tsmc is a valued supplier to Intel products and important partner to IMS and they've established a very high standard for what it takes to be a worldclass foundary but the market overall needs multiple players and as we execute Intel Foundry has a very important role to play globally and especially here in the us where we continue to invest in Leading Edge R&D and Manufacturing capacity we're also pleased to sign with the US Department of Commerce a definitive agreement awarding us up to $ 7.86 billion in Grants as you know these grants are Milestone based and we have already received $1.1 billion in Q4 and have received an additional $1.1 billion in January of q1 in addition we continue to make good progress building out our secure Enclave in partnership with the Department of Defense we look forward to continued engagement with the Trump Administration as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen us Technology and Manufacturing leadership finally as you will recall we announced Our intention to establish an independent subsidiary structure for Intel Foundry to provide clear governance and operational separation this structure also enables us to seek additional funding options from both strategic and Financial Partners which we are now actively beginning to explore let me now turn to our Consolidated Financial results and q1 guidance 14.3 billion up 7% sequentially and at the high end of the range we provided in October as a result of solid growth in ccg equipment sales at Ms and the edge business of NX non-gaap gross margin came in at 42.1% 260 basis points ahead of guidance on higher Revenue better costs and the receipt of our first chips Grant offset partially by inventory reserves related to gouty we delivered fourth quarter earnings per share of 13 cents versus our guidance of 12 cents higher Revenue stronger gross margin and improved operating leverage was offset by lower interest and income which includes an acral related to our second skip agreement of roughly $750 million reflecting an an adjustment in our planned capacity ramp in Ireland in Q2 we began the process of resizing our expense structure to support more modest long-term growth including adjusting our capacity plans to more conservative levels driving impairments in Q3 and this acral in Q4 Q4 operating cash flow was positive $3.2 billion down approximately $900 million sequentially due to the cash outlays associated with our Q3 restructuring charges we had gross capb backs of $6.3 billion with offsets of $1.6 billion in the quarter resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.5 billion as I mentioned earlier we also received a portion of the chips grants this quarter for the full year revenue is $ 53.1 billion down 2.1% year-over-year modest year-over-year growth in Intel products was more than offset by lower Revenue at Mobil ey and Altera as well as the forecasted decline in Foundry Services due to the end of life on traditional packaging Revenue full year gross margin was 36% and down 760 basis points due to Q3 impairments lower revenue and inventory impacts full year EPS was minus33 and down $118 on Lower Revenue lower gross margin and higher period charges we generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations made $24 billion of gross Capital Investments and generated capital offsets of approximately 13.4 billion from skip partner contributions and government grants and incentives as a result adjusted free cash flow was minus $2.2 billion and we ended the year with $22.1 billion of cash and short-term Investments moving to segment results for Q4 Intel products Revenue was $13 billion up 7% sequentially ccg Revenue was up 9% quarter over quarter as the rate at which our customers digested inventory slowed meaningfully from Q3 while difficult to quantify we suspect a portion of Q4 Revenue upside was due to customers hedging against potential tariffs DCI Revenue was up slightly sequentially off a better than expected Q3 as demand for traditional servers remained stable revenue for nexx was up 7.5% sequentially and is now up more than 20% from Q2 lows as customers are returning to more normal buying patterns especially in our Edge business operating profit for Intel products was $3.6 billion 28% of Revenue Vue and up $300 million quarter over quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.5 billion up 3% sequentially on increased euv wafer mix and higher equipment sales by IMS euv wafer Revenue Grew From 1% of total revenue in 2023 to greater than 5% in 2024 Intel Foundry operating loss in Q4 of $2.3 billion improved meaningfully sequentially as Q3 was impacted by $3.1 billion of impairments excluding impairments operating loss would have been roughly flat quarter on quarter turning to all other mobile ey reported revenue of $490 million up 1% sequentially with operating profit of $103 million and earlier today guided for full year 2025 increases to both revenue and operating income Altera delivered revenue of $429 million up 4% sequentially operating margin was 21% versus 2% in Q3 on better gross margins and operating leverage for q1 we expect Altera Revenue to be down sequentially less than overall Intel Consolidated we continue to make good progress on the stake sale of Altera and see a path for an IPO in the coming years now turning to guidance q1 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter of the Year down high single to low double digits percentage sequentially on average in addition we see added pressure coming from macro uncertainty especially around tariffs balancing of PC inventory and increasing competition these mitigating factors support a more tempered Revenue Outlook as we come into the new year as a result we're forecasting a revenue range of 11.7 to 12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025 down between 11 to 18% sequentially within Intel product we expect Revenue to decline across all three of our segments at roughly similar rates we expect Intel Foundry Revenue roughly flat to down modestly quarter over quarter helped by continued mix shift to euv Wafers Intel 18a samples and advanced packaging at the midpoint of 12.2 billion we expect gross margin of approximately 36% with a tax rate of 12% and break even EPS all on a non-gaap basis let me take a few moments to provide some commentary that may be helpful for your full year 2025 modeling at the Consolidated level we expect gross margin to improve from q1 Intel products gross margin was 51% in 2024 and is expected to decline this year due to product mix in both ccg and DCI Intel founder gross margin will improve on euv mix shift and growth in advanced packaging despite expected depreciation growth in 2025 of roughly 10% we continue to Target 2025 opcs of$ 17.5 billion with further reductions in 2026 we expect non-controlled income or NCI to net to roughly zero in q1 and be in the range of 500 to 700 million impact this year on a gap basis NCI is expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 to a range of 1.2 to $1.4 billion on a gap basis and increase further in future years as we increase we for routs at our Fabs where we have agreements with skip Partners we anticipate that our 2025 gross Capital investments will be approximately 20 billion at the low end of our previous guide of 20 to2 23 billion reflecting further capacity adjustments to Ohio and Ireland as well as better utilization of what we call our Construction in progress specifically we invested ahead of demand over the past few years and these capital investments will enable us to meet expected demand at a lower level of spending as we drive to more efficiently deploy our Capital we expect 2025 net capex of 8 to 11 billion with roughly half of the offsets expected to come from government incentives and tax credits and half from partner contributions delivering in 2025 remains a top priority for us on Lower capex increased cash from operations and value unlock across our non-core assets finally I'll will remind you that we will provide new segment reporting in conjunction with our q1 earnings we expect to make further changes to our segments including moving the edge portion of NX into ccg and our auto business from all other into ccg in addition we expect to move the networking portion of anex which includes Zeon sales into DCI and the IMs equipment business out of Intel Foundry into all other I'll wrap up by saying that Q4 was a solid quarter to close out a challenging year with that said our profitability is below where it needs to be and we must enhance our competitive position in the market Michelle and I will continue taking actions to improve the operational and financial trajectory of the business we'll remain focused on building a stronger Intel products business and becoming a more efficient Intel Foundry and by driving continued progress in these areas we're confident in our ability to unlock value for our stakeholders before you the line to questions it's worth mentioning that the board remains intensely focused on the search for a permanent CEO the search is progressing but we have nothing new to report and won't be able to add additional information on this topic today with that I'll turn it over to John to start the Q&A thank you Dave we will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call as a reminder we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable with Jonathan can we take the first question please certainly and our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank your question please hi guys thanks for me ask a question I guess the first one would be for MJ you talked about no quick fixes uh but a lot of things to improve the road map specifically on the DCI side of things can you talk about how much you think Granite is closing the Gap it sounds like clear waterer Forest has not mentioned nearly as much as far as a 2025 event neither from launch or from a revenue perspective so if there's any updates on that and then just overall what it's going to take uh and when do you think we will be able to externally see that Gap close versus competitors sure thanks for the question Ross um I look at it this way so when I talk about no quick fixes I think it's going to be one to two years of consistent execution and continuing to see better products each year really to bring our customers back to the table and be excited about Intel road map Granite Rapids is a good first step in doing that it does close the gap our customers are excited about it and we are starting to see the competitiveness of that product materialize in volume but I'm also very cleare eyed about where we stand and so we've just got to see that continued throughout 26 when we get to Diamond Rapids Etc so you also asked me about Clearwater Forest so I really look at the data center Market in kind of two buckets we have our PE Corp products which you know is granite Rapids and then we have our EC cor products which equates to Clear Water forest and what we've seen is that's more of a niche market and we haven't seen volume materialized there as fast as we expected but as we look at Clear Water Forest we expect that to come to Market in the first half of 2026 18a is doing just fine on its performance and yields for granite Rapids but it does have some complicated pack packaging um expectations that move it to 2026 um but we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well but this is going to be a journey it's not a destination Ross do you have a follow-up question yeah switching over to Dave on the profitability side uh can you just walk us through some of the puts in takes on the gross margin sequentially in the first quarter obviously revenues are down but anything else and then you mentioned that it would be the low point of the year the gross margin in the first quarter but uh what would be the headwinds and Tailwinds as you think through 2025 as a whole on that metric thank you yeah thanks Ross um okay so for the first quarter the biggest obvious contributor to gross margins uh sequentially is the revenue decline um you know at the midpoint we're declining a little over $2 billion doar and So that obviously you know on a mostly fixed cost business that does affect it we also did have a couple of bluebirds uh in Q4 one was the revenue beat and so that actually elevated the revenue a bit but the other was when we signed the chips uh agreement uh we were able to take some of the Grant and acre it as uh you know kind of a benefit to cost of sales because it it offset period expenses we had spent uh before so uh I we weren't sure we were going to sign it in the fourth quarter which is why I didn't guide that in the uh in the guidance from last quarter but you know obviously materialized and that pushed the gross margins up for the fourth quarter um in the first quarter I think you know what and we've kind of tell graph this now for several quarters you know Intel products gross margins are going to be under pressure this year uh some of the parts have a higher cost in particular lunar lake has a higher cost uh as you know because it's got the memory in package and so you know we're basically buying that memory and turning around and selling it at the same price that's really weighing the margins down on lunar lake so margins for products is going to be under pressure pretty much throughout this year then his Panther Lake comes you know in volume next year uh more materially and you know the in addition the products beyond that uh we'll start to see some improvement in margins on Intel products uh now that was always to off be offset in a lot of ways by the margins of Intel Foundry uh you know we see more of a mix of euv Wafers they have better pricing with a better cost and so we'll see a mix Improvement throughout the year we're also reducing our spending there in Period expenses with as part of our you know kind of overall $10 billion plus cost spending reduction but it doesn't really show up in the first quarter it's not until we get into the second and third quarter that we start to see uh that Improvement uh show up so those are really the bigger drivers of margins on the on the first quarter um it is a low Point as as we talked about you know the benefits are going to be really around you know margins improving on Intel Foundry uh as the mix of EU wavers uh increases throughout the year in particular as we get Panther Lake in there in the back half of the and we're selling uh 18a Wafers at a higher margin uh and um you know then next year we have Panther Lake in more volume and all those Wafers start to come back and that becomes a really big benefit uh to Intel overall thank you Ross Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasin from birnen research your question please hi guys thanks for taking my question um first question just on the segment guide for next quarter why are all three product segments down equally when it sounds like you've got more headwinds just on the surface of PCS inventory digestion and maybe the roll off of some of that tariff pull forward what's going on in the in the data center and the NX businesses that makes them as bad as a client in into q1 well broadly uh across all markets and we you know we didn't necessarily Telegraph every market in terms of where we think but i' say broadly you know we're we're a little bit cautious on the macro and that affects all markets uh in addition you know seasonality does play in most of the markets and that that does impact uh the first quarter as well so I would say you know combination of just macro uncertainty combined with uh you know kind of typical seasonality across all the businesses Jon do you have a follow-up question um yeah I do thank you um so you also talked about increased competitiveness Weighing on on margins at least into q1 so again I presume that's a question on pricing I guess is that right do you expect that to persist through the year and how do you think about that competitiveness potentially waiting on pricing across client and especially in in the in the data center yes okay so the co- CEOs are trying to figure out who should answer okay go ahead whoever want take it yeah um the way I look at that is we do have increased competition as we see New Market entrance particularly come in to ccg um we've got a very good product in lunar Lake there but as Dave talked about you know the margins on that product are more pressured based on the cost of the product but we are going to stem the market segment share decline in client and we're going to go after winning every socket that mirrors itself when you think about the data center Market as well as I said Granite Rapids is a very positive step in a competitive Direction but we have to stem the tide of share loss in Data Center and so we will be fighting for every socket in that business and the way I look at it is we need to be aggressive we need to win share and we need to show our customers that they can win with us thank you Stacy Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes from the line PJ muse from caner fitgerald your question please yeah good afternoon thank you for taking the question um I guess first question uh under your new co-leadership uh we'd be curious to hear um how your strategy um has potentially evolved specifically for IFS I mean I think uh and we've talked about this over the last couple quarters I mean for one we are not looking to spend ahead of success and so you know you saw our Capa guide come down from the 20 to 23 range down to 20 that's in in um you know in support of that uh that strategy uh you know we want to absolutely wow the customers but to do that we've got to be very careful around what we're promising them as well so I think what you'll see see a lot of is a little bit more conservatism around how we deploy Capital how we engage with customers we want to be doing more than what we promise uh to every turn to every stakeholder including investors including customers including suppliers so what have you that's pretty much the the the strategy the main goal of building a worldclass boundary that's still in place uh you know we we feel that there absolutely is a need for another player in the Leading Edge semiconductor manufact uring space in particular in the US it aligns with the government the US government's interests as well so we're we're absolutely committed to that it's now about being very cautious and careful around generating the best roic for the shareholders CJ do you have a follow-up question I do thanks um I guess Dave another question for you um I believe that you know three three months ago the the stated goal for 2025 was to be free cash flow positive I guess given kind of the weakness we're seeing in q1 and uncertainty can you kind of walk through how how you're thinking about um the path to Turning free cash flow positive yeah so we're we're not obviously guiding uh you know beyond the first quarter but I would just say we you know we we did a very good job in a challenging uh situation in 24 around c s from operations by driving strong working Capital Improvements and we adjusted capex accordingly and uh and that helped you know stem the tide so while we were negative in before uh you know we were closer to zero than we should have been based on the Topline results I'd say it's more about the same uh in 25 we're going to be cutely focused on cash flow from operations really managing working capital effectively uh we adjusted the capex down as I talked about uh in relationship to a different Outlook uh we do expect some pretty significant um uh offsets as well more than $10 billion of offsets which will also help uh you know I won't throw out a number yet for for adjusted free cash flow for the year but I would just say that it's a focus that we that we're where we want to improve I would say in addition to that you know we have these non-core businesses and we see opportunity to monetize there that will help us delever because that's a focus of us focus of ours in 2025 uh we are you know far along on the process of Altera uh I suspect that by the time we get earnings next next quarter we'll have something to say there that will help generate some cash that we can use to to delever thanks DJ Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley your question please great thank you um in the prepared remarks you made reference to the sort of tempering of expectations of Falcon Shores can you talk about you know the you know what was find that and kind of what does it take for you to get uh competitive in that space uh yeah of course I can Joe I think it really comes down to taking the time over the last six weeks to actively engage with the teams look at our road maps look at where we are from a competitive perspective and from an execution P perspective and that really resulted in that decision a lot of conversations with my customers as well in regards to what do they see is needed to be com competitive and to deliver the right product and so when I looked at that obviously we have our gouty product we're learning a lot from that but one of the things that we've learned from gouty is it's not enough to just deliver the Silicon we need to be able to deliver a complete rack scale solution and that's what we're going to be able to do with Falcon excuse me with Jaguar Shores Falcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system networking memory all the component functions of that but what customers really want is that full scale rack solution and so we're able to get to that with Jaguar Shores I think we've ALS seen a lot this week with deep seek and a lot of the excitement around not one size fits all and so I'm also trying to look at the road map to say there's a lot of Ip and assets that we have as Intel product Co that we can leverage to address this market we've got great CPUs gpus as6 fpgas and we need to figure out how we harness those because if we've seen anything this week when there are constraints put on customers they figure out different ways to deploy technology and so that's also a great opportunity and something that I'm looking at and looking at if there's ways that we can be disruptive there Joe do you have a follow-up question I do and and thank you for your cander about all of that I think I separately you mentioned in the prepared remarks about you know potentially seeing tffs driving some some pull forward can you just talk about you know how pervasive that might be is that conservatism that that might be happening are you seeing evidence that that's happening just some color on on where that's coming from yeah I mean we you know we obviously have a fairly good sense of uh you know what customers uh you know need from quarter to quarter and in a couple of instances customers uh ordered more than we think they were digesting uh and so you know it was really you know just the analytics that gave us insight into they're doing that for a reason and we know tariffs are a big um you know subject uh of a lot of our customers uh it was in the region you might expect in the Asian region that we saw this uh you know I it's hard for me to extrapolate this Beyond this quarter um you know A lot's not known yet around what might be the plans on tariffs I just thought it was a little bit of hedging going on by customers that you know pulled Revenue into the fourth quarter and away from the first quarter thank you Joe Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes in line of Timothy urry from UBS your question please thanks a lot um Dave I also wanted to ask about gross margin um I think the message you were saying is that it's kind of 60% um incremental and that was kind of off of the 395 that you guided for uh you know Q four but obviously you came in you had these one-timers and now we're down in March so can you just sort of like level set us for kind of how to think of the incrementals from here incrementals from q1 in other words into Q2 three and four is that what you're saying yeah just yeah just kind of like is it off a 39 yeah yeah the the rule of thumb has generally been 60% in this period of what what I call catchup obviously we think we can do better fall through as we get more stabilized um the one dynamic in 25 is this uh you know kind of margin pressure around product like lunar Lake that that probably you know pulls the range down to probably something more like in the 40 to 60% fall through is probably the right way to think about it uh just for for that Dynamic now we get into 26 and you start to see you know a lot more 18a volume through Panther Lake you know I think we're in the 60% plus range at that level Tim do you have a follow on question I do um yeah Dave also so um you took the capex to the low end but there's a billion two outflow that's in the financing section of the cash flow statement what what what is that I guess I'm trying to figure out just on an Apples to Apples basis is like capex really coming down this year and is that line item in the financing section is that going to keep getting bigger this year thanks yeah no the fin the you know the let's see let me go back in the capex um if you look at capex for to for 25 the 20 the 20 20 billion dollar forecast what's driving that lower is really a function of you better utilizing assets under construction so you know our philosophy had been to invest kind of ahead of uh what was required and we built up a pretty significant balance in assets under construction I mean to the tune of greater than $50 billion so we actually have a lot of capital on the balance sheet that really hasn't been deployed and so what we pushed the teams to do in an effort to drive better you know Roa and return on invested capital is to have them digest as much as that as possible and limit the amount of purchases uh that we that we make externally and that all that's going to allow us to get down to the to the2 billion range I would be we're not doing any funky financing around this but I would uh be you know in the spirit of transparency say that you know capex is two things right it's what what you place in terms of orders on equipment and it's when you give them the cash and so for sure we are working the payment terms of suppliers uh to improve our uh you know to improve our cap backs lower our cap backs that that is pushing uh you know spend out even as we're getting the Assets in but quite honestly by the time we've actually deployed it and it's depreciating we've actually in all cases I think spent the money um because it it goes onto assets under construction it probably hangs in there for like nine months before it's ever deployed thank you Tim Jonathan can we have the next question certainly our next question comes from the line of V area from Bank of America Securities your question please uh thanks for taking my question uh first uh kind of related questions are on uh the data center server on CPU Market um M I'm curious when you look at um you know Intel versus your x86 competitor do you think their share gains are because of better design or access to better you know manufacturing um and so what can be fixed and you know what will take uh time to fix so if you were to Outsource more right to external Foundry does does that help you regain a share and I imagine that applies more more to Cloud uh and then on the Enterprise side have you seen any share shifts uh at all uh over the last few years thanks VC um well as we look at Data Center and the competitiveness um as I said or stated earlier um you know Granite Rapids did a good job of making a good first step in closing the Gap versus competition but we still have a gap and so we've got to be laser focused next on delivering Diamond Rapids and the feedback for both of those products early is very is very positive when it comes to external manufacturing I've been pretty transparent about this and the way um I think about it in My Philosophy you know the way I look at it is you have to have the right product the right process and you have to deliver that within the right Market window if you look at Intel as overall today we do about 30% of our manufacturing externally across a variety of Partners that's probably the high for where we are today but it will never be 0% um what I can tell you is 18a is going well they earned my business obviously both for Panther Lake and for Clear waterer Forest but as I think about being more competitive in data center moving forward and I look at Future designs I will ask myself that question every time as we look at the road mapap so I think it would not be unfathomable that I would put a data center product outside if that meant that I hit the right product the right Market window as well as the right performance for my customers do you have a followup question yes thank you John so maybe one for Dave on this non-controlling interest I think Dave you said 5 to 700 million uh for this year so a little bit lower than um you know than I think the 700 you had before but then it starts to grow to 1.2 or 1.4 billion is this always going to you know keep on increasing um right like what is the right way for us to model it because the less you Outsource I I guess the more you insource the more you give to int Foundry the more reversals um right you have to do on this NCI part I I would imagine so is there a reasonable way to model how much of a headwind this is to your reported EPS yeah it's a good question I mean let just to break it all out it's more than just the Skips Skip one and two are obviously in there but but also uh mobilize shows up in non-controlling interest and as we sell down uh stakes in companies like mobile Altera it actually exacerbates that NCI so Altera doesn't have any NCI but as soon as we sell a stake it is going to have NCI so there are a number of things that go into it which makes it a little bit difficult to forecast because you have to kind of know what you have to know two things with certainty one exactly what share of every asset you have and to you know what your production is going to look like in the Fabs that you have um have these skips um so what we felt comfortable was was guiding uh guiding 25 and and giving you an indication for 26 it's likely to go up in 27 uh but I think it's probably too soon to actually identify what the exact number will look look like thanks for that Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly our next question comes from the line Ben rtis from melus your question please hey guys uh thanks lot for the question uh Dave and MJ I wanted to you know I know in your prepared remarks you said you look forward to working with the Trump Administration um I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about your initial talks with them uh have they reached out and who who's like leading the discussions from your side and you know any any color on what you're what you're exactly talking about and what they're particularly interested in I mean Howard lutnick obviously he sounds like this is very near and dear to him uh during his confirmation hearings and um would love to just kind of get a little bit more color on where you what you have done so far and where you think it's going um and then I'll have a followup thanks so much guys yeah okay thanks Ben uh maybe I'll take that as the co-ceo how's that um the uh you know we have good engagement with them we've we've really been engaged since the election uh with the team uh you know at various levels obviously uh at the CEO level uh but also we have a strong government Affairs team that engages with them every day uh I feel really good about their outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the US uh I think this is a very positive sign obviously for us quite honestly we never left the US so we're in a kind of the pole position in that regard uh and I think they understand the value of doing R&D in the US uh for advanced semiconductor manufacturing which also is positive um you know they want to see more jobs coming back to the US uh we pay high wage high-tech jobs uh so that's obviously positive for them but more importantly you know this is about security both in terms of just the supply chain but also in you know kind of secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense uh which you know we're obviously in a in a position to do for them um you know I imagine that you know as we progress uh we'll be more engaged with them uh to make this a reality uh and uh both Michelle and I will be meeting um fairly regularly with with the Trump Administration uh officials to go make their their goals a reality for the US Ben you said you had a followup yeah thanks um I want to double click on a prior question on Gross margins and and ask it a a little bit more in caveman terms rather than incrementals um you know you talked about one Q being the bottom um I'm trying to figure out you know how high you know it goes sequentially as we go throughout the year giving sounds like you're going to be a lot more price aggressive in server CPUs and client CPUs from what I heard so you know in addition to you know I'm trying to balance that with the thought of of Outsourcing more to tsmc for the year Etc so if that's the low point I guess what I'm trying to say can you be more prescriptive in light of that pricing comment I made and and if it's right you know then just give us a little more color on where we go from the one Q that'd be great thanks yeah yeah I mean you intend to be competitive uh in the product space and also you know as I mentioned the cost structure is uh you know under some pressure in particular because of lunar Lake uh so that that absolutely will impact the gross margins on products uh there won't be a lot of lift uh in that business unit uh through the year and it's really not until Panther Lake comes that they I think start to see some better cost structure and you know have a have a part that's very competitive that I think allows us to uh you know perhaps even relax some of that um that pressure in a competitive market that said The Foundry business will see improvements um you know over the course of the year uh more Wafers will will be coming back uh with Panther Lake it becomes even better uh in the following year uh we are improving the cost structure of The Foundry business as part of our overall spending reduction plan so that will also help and then just keep in mind you know these these Wafers that uh we're producing at Intel 3 and ATA uh have much better cost structure uh and margin structure uh relative I should say Rel relative to the price structure uh than their predecessors and that will be beneficial on The Foundry side so in the caveman uh macro sense I think the best thing to do is probably take this like somewhere in the 40 to 60% fall through and that's probably the right rough order math uh to get you to where the margins will go in any quarter based on you know what you're projecting the revenue to be in that quarter thanks Ben Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly our next question comes from the line of Aaron rers from Fargo your question please yeah thanks for taking a question I want to build off of that that that last question a little bit you know during the prepared remarks you you had mentioned 1% in 2023 was euv uh wafer mix and that that progressed to north of 5% uh this year can c can you give us a a framework of how how you would define success uh looking through 2025 maybe exiting the year as far as euv wafer mix and remind us again what the what the the Delta is and terms of cost structure the the margin dynamics of an EU euv wafer yeah well I'll say um on the second part maybe I'll I'll answer that one first I would say the price on those Wafers goes up at 3x the cost of those of those W or sorry maybe said it the Blended ASP and cost goes up three uh 3x as you go to 18a versus the the cost so it's a pretty dramatic Improvement in Gross margins uh as you move into 18a versus you know pre waivers um you know I I probably be tough for me to Hazard a guess on exactly how we'll exit the year in terms of our percentage of euv it's definitely going to go up um you know granted is on Intel 3 uh Panther Lake is is on uh metor lake is on Intel 3 or four called 4 three weight node uh Panther Lake is on 18a this year so we'll we'll see a pretty meaningful jump in the percentage of Wafers that will be euv uh as we exit 25 y do you have a followup question I I do and it's probably a dumb question but I'm just going to ask it because I'm just a little confused that you know the skip impact this this five to 700 million going to 1.2 billion just just remind us again so we're all clear that when you report EPS on a on a on a non-gaap basis that's that's in that EPS number just so we I'm modeling it correctly I'm sure my my peers are already but I I want to make sure I've got that all clear in my head yeah I just want to make be clear it's not just skip I mean that includes the mobile eye income uh and will include the Altera income to some extent but yeah all of that in the NCI we do take it against our non-gaap uh number to to get our fully deluded non-gaap PPS number Aaron thank you Jonathan we have time for one more question certainly and our final question for today comes from the line of sery paseri from Raymond James your question please thank you thanks for squeezing me in um Dave on the um Foundry break even I guess Target for 2027 maybe can you um talk about what are the assumptions behind that I mean do you think you can get there with u you know mostly internal Wafers or do you need external customers as well if so you know what sort of Revenue do we need from external customers to I guess achieve that break even yeah so you know we're still aiming to get uh to break even in 27 as you pointed out it's really on the back of internal Wafers or you know Wafers from Intel products I should say um and uh you know it's it's you know obviously a lot based on uh euv Wafers which carry a better margin and as that mix improves that significantly improves uh the margins but more importantly I I think you know the original premise by creating this different p&l structure was to drive the boundary business really at that point was just a function manufacturing to be more focused on efficiency to squeeze out more from the existing footprint to be more sensitive to Capital and ultimately just think about roic and everything they do and I think that has worked actually I mean I hear it all the time it's amazing the transformation we've seen in staff meetings and Michelle and I uh that attend that you know how they're they're they completely pivoted to how to make money uh in that business and so I think it's working uh I think we'll see significantly more efficiency as we go into uh you know work through 25 and into 26 so I feel good about our ability to get to break even obviously we we want to have uh external customers and so you know we have a some some very small amount that we've assumed for 27 uh but if 18a looks like it's it's something that hunts based on feedback from customers and I feel like we will probably outperform in that regard uh in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers so you know those are all the factors that I think will drive uh 27 to profitability and ultimately obviously want to get to or PR the break even and ultimately want to get the business to a to a profitable level that's you know consistent with what The Foundry industry gets Trina do you have a quick follow one yeah quick one so on the 18a Panther Lake U I think in the past I think Dave the comment was that you know you you expect to bring roughly 70% of the die inhouse is that still the plan and then is that pretty set in stone that you know you're bringing it back for sure or do you have any flexibility uh whether to bring back more of the D or less of the D you know if you need to so just trying to understand you know yeah I'm gonna let Michelle answer that because it really is her decision on how she builds her products yeah so we did move Panther Lake um inside it's an 18a design one but as I stated before you know we look at each generation of product based on what's the right product what's the right process what's the right Market window and what allows our customers to win so for Panther Lake that was 18a and as I said we're very happy with where we are from a performance and yield perspective at this point in the process so that will stay on 188 then as you look forward to you know our next Generation product for client after that Nova Lake we'll actually have die both inside and outside for that process so you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside again it's about optimizing to what allows us to win in the market what allows us to win with our customers and optimizing the overall product portfolio because at the end of the day if our customers are successful we win that drives more you know wafers in Intel Foundry and that allows us to win but I'll continue to have a balance and as I said we'll be doing the same look across our data center portfolio as well all right thanks Michelle so with that let me wrap up by saying thank you uh as always for joining the call uh MJ and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress and the actions we've taken Q4 was a good step forward obviously but we have have a lot of hard work ahead of us and we're looking forward to updating you as we go along we hope to see many of you in person at the investors conferences will be attending in q1 and I'd also like to highlight that the Intel boundary team will be hosting their second annual Direct

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with INTC.\\n\\n\\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\\nPositive Points\\n\\n\\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered revenue, gross margin, and EPS above guidance for Q4 2024.\\n\\n\\nThe company achieved key grant-related milestones, supporting solid upside to gross margins.\\n\\n\\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) remains a market leader in AI PC CPUs, with plans to ship over 100 million systems by the end of 2025.\\n\\n\\nThe launch of Panther Lake on Intel 18A is on track for the second half of 2025, showcasing progress in performance and yield.\\n\\n\\nIntel Foundry has made good progress with Intel 18A, showing competitive offerings and a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers.\\n\\n\\nNegative Points\\n\\n\\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) faces increased competition in the AI PC category, impacting market dynamics.\\n\\n\\nThe company is not yet participating meaningfully in the cloud-based AI data center market.\\n\\n\\nIntel Foundry reported a significant operating loss of over $13 billion in 2024, with negative gross margins.\\n\\n\\nQ1 2025 guidance indicates a sequential revenue decline of 11% to 18%, reflecting macro uncertainty and seasonality.\\n\\n\\nIntel Products' gross margins are expected to be under pressure throughout 2025 due to product mix and cost structure.\\n\\n\\nQ & A Highlights\\nQ: Can you talk about how much you think Granite Rapids is closing the gap in the DCAI side of things and any updates on Clearwater Forest? A: Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Interim Co-CEO, explained that Granite Rapids is a good first step in closing the gap with competitors, and customers are excited about it. Clearwater Forest is seen as a niche market product, expected to come to market in the first half of 2026. The focus is on consistent execution over the next 1 to 2 years to improve competitiveness.\\nStory Continues\\nQ: Can you walk us through the gross margin sequentially in the first quarter and the headwinds and tailwinds for 2025? A: David Zinsner, Interim Co-CEO and CFO, noted that the revenue decline is the biggest contributor to lower gross margins in Q1. Intel Products' margins will be under pressure due to higher costs, particularly with Lunar Lake. Improvements are expected later in the year with Panther Lake and increased EUV wafer mix in Intel Foundry.\\nQ: Why are all three product segments down equally in the next quarter? A: David Zinsner explained that macro uncertainty and typical seasonality are affecting all markets, leading to a cautious outlook across all segments.\\nQ: How has your strategy evolved for Intel Foundry Services (IFS) under new co-leadership? A: David Zinsner emphasized a more conservative approach, focusing on not spending ahead of success and being cautious with capital deployment. The goal remains to build a world-class foundry, aligning with US government interests.\\nQ: What was behind the tempering of expectations for Falcon Shores, and what does it take to get competitive in that space? A: Michelle Johnston Holthaus stated that the decision was based on competitive and execution perspectives. The focus is on delivering a complete rack-scale solution with Jaguar Shores, leveraging learnings from Gaudi, and addressing customer needs for a full-scale solution.\\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\\nView Comments\\nTerms and Privacy Policy\\nPrivacy Dashboard\\nMore Info\\n\\nRecommended Stories\\n\\nCopyright © 2025 Yahoo.

With a market cap of $88.7 billion, Intel drives technological advancements by delivering cutting-edge processors and solutions that power data centers, personal computing, and artificial intelligence. The company is set to release its Q4 earnings on Thursday, Jan. 23.\\nAhead of the event, analysts expect Intel to report a loss of $0.04 per share, down 110.5% from $0.38 in the year-ago quarter. The company missed the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while beating on another occasion.\\nIts adjusted loss of $0.63 per share for the last quarter missed the consensus estimate by 215%. Intel’s Q3 miss was driven by a $3.1 billion impairment charge, weaker PC and server demand, and ongoing operational challenges.\\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect Intel to report a loss per share of $0.87, down 329% from a profit of $0.38 per share in fiscal 2023. However, in fiscal 2025, EPS is expected to rebound, growing by 124.1% year-over-year to $0.21.\\n\\nwww.barchart.com\\nIntel's shares have declined 56.3% over the past 52 weeks, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 26.3% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLK) 27.1% gain during the same period.\\n\\nwww.barchart.com\\nINTC stock dropped over 5% on Dec. 18, contributing to a broader sell-off in chip stocks that erased early market gains. Despite ongoing challenges, INTC jumped 7.8% following its Q3 earnings results on Oct. 31. The company reported revenue of $13.28 billion, beating analyst expectations by 1.8%, though sales fell 6.2% year over year.\\nFor Q4 2024, Intel projects revenue of $13.8 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts. However, steep declines in key metrics, such as a 15% gross margin and negative free cash flow of $2.7 billion, continue to raise concerns about its profitability and operations.\\nWall Street maintains a cautious stance on Intel, with a consensus rating of \\\"Hold.\\\" Among the 37 analysts covering the stock, one rates it a \\\"Strong Buy,\\\" 30 recommend \\\"Hold,\\\" one suggests a \\\"Moderate Sell,\\\" and five rate it as a \\\"Strong Sell.\\\"\\nThe average price target of $26.10 indicates a potential upside of 26.9% from current levels.\\nOn the date of publication, Rashmi Kumari did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Zinsner explained that the decline is due to a combination of macro uncertainty and typical seasonality across all markets. He added that the company is cautious about the macro environment and that seasonality affects all markets.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the persistence of the decline in client and data center segments through the year and the impact of increased competition on pricing.\\n\\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus explained that the company faces increased competition from new market entrants, particularly in the CCG market, and that the margins on the Lunar Lake product are more pressured due to the cost of the product. However, the company is committed to stemming the market segment share decline in client and data center and will be aggressive in winning every socket.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the incremental growth rate from Q4 to Q2, Q3, and Q4.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner explained that the incremental growth rate from Q4 to Q2, Q3, and Q4 is not clear and that the company is still working on it.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the CapEx budget for 2025 and whether it is coming down this year.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner explained that the CapEx budget for 2025 is $20 billion, which is lower than the previous budget due to better utilization of assets under construction. The company has a significant balance in assets under construction, which has not been fully deployed, and the team is working to digest as much as possible and limit external purchases to improve ROA and return on invested capital. The company is also working on payment terms with suppliers to improve CapEx and lower costs.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about Intel's approach to outsourcing manufacturing and the impact of external foundries on regaining share, specifically in the cloud and enterprise segments.\\n\\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel's Chief Financial Officer, explained that the company's approach to outsourcing manufacturing is to ensure that it has the right product, process, and market window, and that it will never be completely outsourced. She also mentioned that the company's current outsourcing rate is around 30% and that it may consider outsourcing data center products in the future if it means hitting the right product, market window, and performance for customers.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about modeling the impact of NCI (non-controlling interest) on reported EPS, specifically the impact of selling stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner, Intel's Chief Financial Officer, explained that NCI is affected by more than just SCIPs (stock compensation plans). He mentioned that Mobileye shows up in non-controlling interest, and as Intel sells stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera, it exacerbates the NCI. He also mentioned that it's difficult to forecast the impact of NCI on reported EPS due to the complexity of the situation, and that it's too soon to identify an exact number.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the progress of the discussions with the government officials regarding the semiconductor manufacturing in the US.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner, co-CEO of Intel, stated that they have good engagement with the government officials, including the CEO level, and have a strong government affairs team that engages with them every day. He also mentioned that the government officials are interested in bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the US and that they understand the value of doing R&D in the US. Additionally, they want to see more jobs coming back to the US and are interested in secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the pricing comment and the impact on gross margins on products.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner explained that the cost structure is under some pressure due to Lunar Lake, which will impact the gross margins on products. However, he mentioned that the Foundry business will see improvements over the course of the year, and more wafers will be coming back with Panther Lake, which will have a better cost structure and margin structure relative to the price structure. He suggested that a rough order of math to get to where the margins will go in any quarter based on the projected revenue would be somewhere in the range of 40% to 60%.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the assumptions behind Intel's plan to achieve profitability in 2027, specifically whether it can be achieved with internal wafers or if external customers are also needed.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner, CEO of Intel, explained that the company is aiming to achieve profitability in 2027 based on internal wafers, with a focus on EUV wafers that carry a better margin. He noted that the original premise of creating a different P&L structure was to drive the foundry business towards efficiency and to focus on ROIC. He also mentioned that the company has seen a transformation in staff meetings, with a focus on how to make money in the business, and that they will see significantly more efficiency as they work through 2025 and into 2026. He acknowledged that the company wants to have external customers, but that they have assumed a small amount for 2027, and that they will probably outperform in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers. He concluded by stating that the company wants to achieve profitability and ultimately wants to get the business to a profitable level that's consistent with what the foundry industry gets.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the plan to bring back the die inside the chip for the Panther Lake product and whether it's set in stone or if the company has flexibility to bring back more or less of the die.\\n\\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus, EVP and GM of the Data Platforms Group, explained that the company moved Panther Lake inside of 18A design win, but that it was based on what's the right product, process, market window, and what allows the company's customers to win. She stated that they are very happy with the performance and yield of Panther Lake at this point in the process, and that it will stay on 18A. For the next-generation product, Nova Lake, the company will have compute tiles inside and outside, allowing them to optimize their product portfolio and win in the market. She noted that they will continue to have a balance between internal and external customers, and that they will be doing the same look across their data center portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n\\nSourceQ4 2024 Earnings Call\\nRelated Companies:\\n ASMLASML Holding NV AMDAdvanced Micro Devices Inc AMATApplied Materials Inc AVGOBroadcom Inc NVDANVIDIA Corp NXPINXP Semiconductors N.V.

The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of Intel's internal foundry operating model, Intel announced in the third quarter of 2024 its intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. The company also previously announced its intent to operate Altera® as a standalone business. Altera was previously included in DCAI's segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \\\"all other.\\\" As a result of these changes, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives information and manages and monitors its operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to Intel’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.\\nBusiness Unit Revenue and Trends Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023 2024 vs. 2023Intel Products:          Client Computing Group (CCG) $8.0 billion down9% $30.3 billion up4%Data Center and AI (DCAI) $3.4 billion down3% $12.8 billion up1%Network and Edge (NEX) $1.6 billion up10% $5.8 billion up1%Total Intel Products revenue $13.0 billion down6% $48.9 billion up3%Intel Foundry $4.5 billion down13% $17.5 billion down7%All other $1.0 billion down20% $3.8 billion down32%Intersegment eliminations $(4.3) billion    $(17.2) billion   Total net revenue $14.3 billion down7% $53.1 billion down2%\\nIntel Products Highlights\\n\\n\\nCCG: Intel continues to lead the AI PC category.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.\\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related effects to income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate. For 2024 and 2023, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 13%. For 2025, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 12%. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests are calculated by adjusting for the minority stockholder portion of non-GAAP adjustments we make for relevant acquisition-related costs, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and income tax effects, as applicable to each majority-owned subsidiary.\\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\\nNon-GAAPadjustment ormeasureDefinitionUsefulness to management and investorsAcquisition-related adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.Share-based compensationShare-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans.We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.Restructuring and other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. 2024 mainly includes charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, primarily composed of cash-based employee severance and benefit arrangements, and cash and non-cash charges related to real estate exits and consolidations, as well as non-cash construction-in-progress asset impairments resulting from business exit activities. Other charges include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, and other costs associated with certain non-core activities. 2024 includes non-cash charges resulting from the impairment of goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets. 2023 includes a benefit as a result of developments in the VLSI litigation and two legal related fees, which we do not expect to recur, relating to an annulled EC-imposed fine and a termination fee relating to Tower. 2023 also includes costs associated with a formal restructuring plan approved in 2022 and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.(Gains) losses on equity investments, net(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, and the gains (losses) from the sale of equity investments and other.We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures to provide comparability between periods. The exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business.(Gains) losses from divestiture(Gains) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND memory business in 2021, a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Interest received related to an annulled European Commission (EC) fineInterest received in 2024 related to an annulled EC-imposed fine that was paid in 2009 and refunded to us in 2022.We exclude this non-operating and non-recurring interest income for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past results and provides a useful evaluation of our current performance.Deferred tax assets valuation allowancesA non-cash charge recorded to provision for (benefit from) income taxes related to a discreet valuation allowance recorded against our US deferred tax assets.We excluded a discrete non-cash charge in 2024 related to a valuation allowance established against our US deferred tax assets due to a historical cumulative loss for GAAP purposes. We excluded the discreet valuation allowance when calculating certain non-GAAP measures, as there is no such historical cumulative loss on a non-GAAP basis. Because of the size of the charge, the adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to our past operating results.Adjusted free cash flowWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and net partner contributions, and (2) payments on finance leases.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business.Net capital spendingWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of net capital spending, which is additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and net partner contributions.We believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about our capital investment activities and capital offsets, and allows for greater transparency with respect to a key metric used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance.\\nIntel Corporation\\nSupplemental Reconciliations of GAAP Actuals to Non-GAAP Actuals\\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Again as a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, corporate vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our interim co-CEOs, Michelle Johnston Holthaus and Dave Zinsner.\\nAs you know, Michelle is also CEO of Intel products, and Dave continues to serve as Intel's CFO. In a few moments, Michelle will open up with some summary comments before providing more detail on Intel products. Dave will then discuss Intel foundry and the overall financials, including our Q1 guidance. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it.\\nAnd as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures.\\nWith that, let me turn things over to Michelle.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome. It's been roughly two months since Dave and I stepped into our roles as interim co-CEOs. From day one, we have been working closely together alongside the board to drive better execution of our strategy. There are no quick fixes.\\nAnd we are committed to improving our performance and rebuilding our credibility through persistent hard work that delivers tangible results. As part of this, we are driving more focused investments across the business. We cannot be all things to all people, and we are prioritizing areas where we can drive differentiated value. We are also continuing to simplify our business and become a leaner, more efficient company.\\nAnd most of all, we are doing a better job of listening to our customers to ensure we meet their needs. Q4 was a step in the right direction. We delivered revenue, gross margin, and EPS above our guide. Intel products executed to drive revenue in the quarter, even as PC inventory continue to normalize.\\nAnd Intel foundry drove incremental operating efficiencies while achieving key grant-related milestones, which supported solid upside to gross margins. As co-CEOs, you can expect us to be very straightforward and direct. We only make commitments we are confident we can deliver. We firmly believe that what we say is not nearly as important as what we do.\\nAnd everything we do must be in service of our customers. Innovating to solve their most pressing challenges is the surest path to creating shareholder value. This is the mindset I have brought to my position as the CEO of Intel products. This is a great business with great people, partners, and IP to design world-class products from edge to cloud.\\nI take nothing for granted. But I firmly believe that the core x86 architecture and the ecosystem we have built and invested in over the decades, create a solid foundation for success. Our customers share this view. But they need us to improve our execution and hit our commitments.\\nI am setting clear priorities and directions in each business to drive better outcomes. I think about Intel products in three buckets. First, client edge; second, traditional data center; and third, the AI data center. Let me spend a few moments on each.\\nIn client, Intel CPUs power roughly seven out of every 10 PCs. This is a strong position that gives us advantages in the market. That said, the market is becoming more competitive, especially as we see new entrants trying to participate in the AI PC category. Personally, I thrive on competition.\\nIt drives a healthy paranoia across everything we do, and we're using it as motivation to up our game even more. The success of Core Ultra across, Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake has established Intel as the market leader in AI PC CPUs, and we remain on track to ship more than 100 million cumulative systems by the end of 2025. We are innovating at scale unlike any of our competitors. This was on display earlier this month at CES where we launched the enterprise versions of our AI CPUs with compelling new features to Intel vPro.\\nThis is a testament to the strong ecosystem we have built with IT departments, around manageability, security, trust and brand. And we expect these investments to position us well as corporations begin their migration to Windows 11. Alongside our investments in enterprise, our ecosystem reach also positions us well in AI PC consumer markets. We are working with more than 200 ISVs across more than 400 features to optimize their software on our silicon.\\nI'm excited about the new applications I'm seeing in the pipeline that will begin to proliferate over the coming months. Our goal is to innovate, partner and fortify our position as the preferred CPU of choice. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we will strengthen our client road map with the launch of Panther Lake, our lead product on Intel 18A in the second half of 2025. As the first volume customer of Intel 18A, I see the progress that Intel foundry is making on performance and yields, and I look forward to being in production in the second half as we demonstrate the benefits of our world-class design and process technology capabilities.\\n2026 is even more exciting from a client perspective as Panther Lake achieved meaningful volumes, and we introduced our next-generation client family code named Nova Lake. Both will provide strong performance across the entire PC stack with significantly better costs and margins for us, enhancing our competitive position and reinforcing our value proposition to our partners and customers. Let me now turn to our traditional data center business. The team has made good progress toward strengthening our offerings and driving better, more predictable execution.\\nThis year is all about improving Xeon's competitive position as we fight harder to close the gap to competition. The ramp of Granite Rapids has been a good first step. We are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year. All of this provides a strong foundation on which to build as we execute.\\nThe world's data center workloads still primarily run on Intel silicon, and we have a strong ecosystem, especially within enterprise. We are going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025. One of the ways we'll do this is by reengaging the x86 ecosystem. We have seen a positive response from the x86 ecosystem advisory group we formed last fall, and we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for building both semi-custom and custom products.\\nThis is a big area of opportunity for the business, and we look forward to talking more about this as we have news to share. Turning to the AI data center. I will start by saying that this is an attractive market for us over time, but I am not happy with where we are today. On the one hand, we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers.\\nAnd we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU-based inference on-prem and at the edge as AI-infused applications proliferate. On the other hand, we're not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way. We have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi and we are applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our road map and concentrate our resources.\\nMany of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month. Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center. More broadly, as I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably, to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute.\\nAI is not a market in the traditional sense. It's an enabling application that needs to span across the compute continuum from data center to the edge. As such, a one-size-fit-all approach will not work, and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the continuum. Before I turn the call over to Dave, let me close by speaking as Intel foundry's largest wafer customer.\\nI have a pretty simple approach. When we are able to combine world-class products with world-class process technology, we win. As CEO of Intel products, I will always make process technology decisions based on what is best for my customers. And Intel foundry will need to earn my business every day, just as I need to earn the business of my customers.\\nHaving said that, I'm confident in Intel foundry's team ability to support my current and future product road map. And I'm excited to do more business with them as their process technology continues to advance. A stronger Intel product, combined with a more competitive Intel foundry is a recipe for success for Intel overall. Dave, over to you.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Michelle. Let me add my welcome. I'm going to address three topics today: update on Intel foundry; second, Q4 and full year financials; and third, our Q1 guidance. Starting with Intel foundry.\\nI've had an opportunity to meet with a number of our partners and potential customers for Intel foundry over the last couple of months. I come away from those meetings encouraged by the opportunity we have in front of us, and I've received clear feedback on what our customers need from us to succeed. This starts with our execution on Intel 18A. This has been an area of good progress.\\nLike any new process, there have been puts and takes along the way, but overall, we're confident that we are delivering a competitive process. We're excited by the launch of Panther Lake this year and the internal ramp of Intel 18A in the second half that will support increased volumes and improved profitability in 2026. From the perspective of external customers, Intel 18A is a very competitive offering that gives each of them a reason to engage with us. However, foundry wins are about more than just technology.\\nTrust is also a significant factor. Customers must believe you can execute consistently and be willing to invest in IP to port a design to a new foundry. That's why past transitions in the industry have generally started with customers giving new foundry partners smaller volumes then gradually increasing as trust grows. We've made good progress, but to accelerate this, I'm asking the team to redouble their efforts.\\nSupporting IP availability and best-known foundry methods. I'm particularly pleased by the willingness of our suppliers and partners to engage with us augmenting our expertise and hard work with theirs. Job number one is earning the customer's trust. The Intel 18A design wins to date provide good validation of the strategy, and we continue to have a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers.\\nBut we won't win every deal out of the gates. We'll be selective and focused on areas where we are confident that we can be a meaningful contributor to the success of our customer and we look forward to updating you as RFQs become wins. In addition, we continue to have good momentum in advanced packaging and in our collaboration with Tower Semiconductor and UMC. All three are critical to utilize our assets longer for higher rates of return.\\nThis is a good segue into my other key areas of focus for Intel foundry, improving our financials and making sure that we're deploying our capital appropriately. At roughly $18 billion in revenue, Intel foundry today is larger than all but one external foundry. That's clearly not reflected on our P&L with negative gross margins and a greater than $13 billion operating loss in 2024. We're going to systematically attack our costs and remain highly focused on our goal of delivering breakeven operating income for Intel foundry by the end of 2027, and we expect to demonstrate improvements this year.\\nThe financial benefits of shifting our wafer volume from Intel 7 to Intel 18A along with learning to run our fabs more efficiently and our process nodes longer will be important drivers of improving our financials. Beyond 2027, we need to drive to cash flow from operations that supports our capital spending needs and ultimately generate a great return on your capital. I remain very optimistic on our opportunity at Intel foundry. The pervasive growth of AI is driving accelerating and unprecedented demand for silicon, and there continues to be an unmet need for greater choice and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry today.\\nTSMC is a valued supplier to Intel products, an important partner to IMS, and they've established a very high standard for what it takes to be a world-class foundry. But the market overall needs multiple players. And as we execute, Intel foundry has a very important role to play globally and especially here in the U.S., where we continue to invest in leading-edge R&D and manufacturing capacity. We're also pleased to sign with the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce a definitive agreement awarding us up to $7.86 billion in grants. As you know, these grants are milestone-based and we have already received $1.1 billion in Q4 and have received an additional $1.1 billion in January of Q1. In addition, we continue to make good progress building out our Secure Enclave in partnership with the Department of Defense. We look forward to continued engagement with the Trump administration as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen U.S.\\ntechnology and manufacturing leadership. Finally, as you will recall, we announced our intention to establish an independent subsidiary structure for Intel foundry to provide clear governance and operational separation. This structure also enables us to seek additional funding options from both strategic and financial partners, which we are now actively beginning to explore. Let me now turn to our consolidated financial results and Q1 guidance was $14.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of the range we provided in October as a result of solid growth in CCG, equipment sales at IMS and the edge business of NEX Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 42.1%, 260 basis points ahead of guidance on higher revenue, better costs and the receipt of our first chips grant, offset partially by inventory reserves related to Gaudi.\\nWe delivered fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.13 versus our guidance of $0.12. Higher revenue, stronger gross margin, and improved operating leverage was offset by lower interest and other income, which includes an accrual related to our second SCIP agreement of roughly $750 million, reflecting an adjustment in our planned capacity ramp in Ireland. In Q2, we began the process of resizing our expense structure to support more modest long-term growth, including adjusting our capacity plans to more conservative levels, driving impairments in Q3 and this accrual in Q4. Q4 operating cash flow was positive $3.2 billion, down approximately $900 million sequentially due to the cash outlays associated with our Q3 restructuring charges.\\nWe had gross capex of $6.3 billion with offsets of $1.6 billion in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we also received a portion of the chips grants this quarter. For the full year, revenue was $53.1 billion, down 2.1% year over year. Modest year-over-year growth in Intel products was more than offset by lower revenue at Mobileye and Altera, as well as the forecasted decline in foundry services due to the end of life on traditional packaging revenue.\\nFull year gross margin was 36% and down 760 basis points due to Q3 impairments, lower revenue and inventory impacts. Full year EPS was minus $0.13 and down $1.18 on lower revenue, lower gross margin and higher period charges. We generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations, made $24 billion of gross capital investments and generated capital offsets of approximately $13.4 billion from Skip partner contributions and government grants and incentives. As a result, adjusted free cash flow was minus $2.2 billion, and we ended the year with $22.1 billion of cash and short-term investments.\\nMoving to segment results for Q4. Intel products revenue was $13 billion, up 7% sequentially. CCG revenue was up 9% quarter over quarter as the rate at which our customers digested inventory slowed meaningfully from Q3. While difficult to quantify, we suspect a portion of Q4 revenue upside was due to customers' hedging against potential tariffs.\\nDCI revenue was up slightly sequentially of a better-than-expected Q3 as demand for traditional servers remain stable. Revenue per NEX was up 7.5% sequentially and is now up more than 20% from Q2 lows as customers are returning to more normal buying patterns, especially in our edge business. Operating profit for Intel products was $3.6 billion, 28% of revenue and up $300 million quarter over quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Intel foundry delivered revenue of $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially on increased EUV wafer mix and higher equipment sales by IMS.\\nEUV wafer revenue grew from 1% of total revenue in 2023 to greater than 5% in 2024. Intel foundry operating loss in Q4 of $2.3 billion improved meaningfully sequentially as Q3 was impacted by $3.1 billion of impairments. Excluding impairments, operating loss would have been roughly flat quarter on quarter. Turning to All other.\\nMobileye reported revenue of $490 million, up 1% sequentially, with operating profit of $103 million and earlier today guided for full year 2025 increases to both revenue and operating income. Altera delivered revenue of $429 million, up 4% sequentially. Operating margin was 21% versus 2% in Q3 on better gross margins and operating leverage. For Q1, we expect Altera revenue to be down sequentially, less than overall Intel consolidated.\\nWe continue to make good progress on the stake sale of Altera and see a path for an IPO in the coming years. Now turning to guidance. Q1 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, down high single to low double digits percentage sequentially on average. In addition, we see added pressure coming from macro uncertainty, especially around tariffs, balancing of PC inventory and increasing competition.\\nThese mitigating factors support a more tempered revenue outlook as we come into the new year. As a result, we're forecasting a revenue range of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down between 11% to 18% sequentially. Within Intel products, we expect revenue to decline across all three of our segments at roughly similar rates. We expect Intel foundry revenue roughly flat to down modestly quarter over quarter, helped by continued mix shift to EUV wafers, Intel 18A samples and advanced packaging.\\nAt the midpoint of $12.2 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 36%, with a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis. Let me take a few moments to provide some commentary that may be helpful for your full year 2025 modeling. At the consolidated level, we expect gross margin to improve from Q1. Intel products gross margin was 51% in 2024 and is expected to decline this year due to product mix in both CCG and DCAI.\\nIntel foundry gross margin will improve on EUV mix shift and growth in advanced packaging despite expected depreciation growth in 2025 of roughly 10%. We continue to target 2025 opex of $17.5 billion with further reductions in 2026. We expect noncontrolled income or NCI to net to roughly zero in Q1 and be in the range of $500 million to $700 million impact this year on a GAAP basis. NCI is expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 to a range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion on a GAAP basis and increase further in future years as we increase wafer outs at our fabs where we have agreements with SCIP partners.\\nWe anticipate that our 2025 gross capital investments will be approximately $20 billion at the low end of our previous guide of $20 billion to $23 billion reflecting further capacity adjustments to Ohio and Ireland, as well as better utilization of what we call our construction in progress. Specifically, we invested ahead of demand over the past few years, and these capital investments will enable us to meet expected demand at a lower level of spending as we drive to more efficiently deploy our capital. We expect 2025 net capex of $8 billion to $11 billion, with roughly half of the offsets expected to come from government incentives and tax credits and half from partner contributions. Delivering in 2025 remains a top priority for us on lower capex, increased cash from operations, and value unlocked across our noncore assets.\\nFinally, I will remind you that we will provide new segment reporting in conjunction with our Q1 earnings. We expect to make further changes to our segments, including moving the edge portion of NEX into CCG and our auto business from All Other into CCG. In addition, we expect to move the networking portion of NEX, which includes Xeon sales into DCAI and the IMS equipment business out of Intel foundry into All Other. I'll wrap up by saying that Q4 was a solid quarter to close out a challenging year.\\nWith that said, our profitability is below where it needs to be, and we must enhance our competitive position in the market. Michelle and I will continue taking actions to improve the operational and financial trajectory of the business. We'll remain focused on building a stronger Intel products business and becoming a more efficient Intel foundry. And by driving continued progress in these areas, we're confident in our ability to unlock value for our stakeholders.\\nBefore we open the line to questions, it's worth mentioning that the board remains intensely focused on the search for a permanent CEO. The search is progressing, but we have nothing new to report and won't be able to add additional information on this topic today. With that, I'll turn it over to John to start the Q&A.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\nOperator\\nCertainly, and our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\\nRoss Seymore -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one would be for MJ. You talked about no quick fixes, but a lot of things to improve the road map.\\nSpecifically, on the DCAI side of things. Can you talk about how much you think Granite is closing the gap? It sounds like Clearwater Forest is not mentioned nearly as much as far as a 2025 event neither from a launch or from a revenue perspective. So, if there's any updates on that? And then just overall, what it's going to take? And when do you think we will be able to externally see that gap close versus competitors?\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Thanks for the question, Ross. I look at it this way. So, when I talk about no quick fixes, I think it's going to be one to two years of consistent execution and continuing to see better products each year, really to bring our customers back to the table and be excited about Intel's road map.\\nGranite Rapids is a good first step in doing that. It does close the gap. Our customers are excited about it, and we are starting to see the competitiveness of that product materialize in volume. But I'm also very clear about where we stand.\\nAnd so, we've just got to see that continued throughout '26 when we get to Diamond Rapids, etc. So, you also asked me about Clearwater Forest. So, I really look at the data center market in kind of two buckets. We have our P-core products, which you know is Granite Rapids and then we have our E-core products, which equates to Clearwater Forest.\\nAnd what we've seen is that's more of a niche market, and we haven't seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected. But as we look at Clearwater Forest, we expect that to come to market in the first half of 2026. And 18A is doing just fine on a performance and yield for Granite Rapids, but it does have some complicated packaging expectations that move it to 2026. But we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well.\\nBut this is going to be a journey. It's not a destination.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nRoss, do you have a follow-up question?\\nRoss Seymore -- Analyst\\nYeah, switching over to Dave on the profitability side. Can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes on the gross margin sequentially in the first quarter? Obviously, revenues are down, but anything else? And then you mentioned that it would be the low point of the year gross margin in the first quarter. But what would be the headwinds and tailwinds as you think through 2025 as a whole on that metric? Thank you.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Thanks, Ross. OK. So, for the first quarter, the biggest obvious contributor to gross margins sequentially is the revenue decline.\\nAt the midpoint, we're declining a little over $2 billion. And so that obviously on a mostly fixed cost business, that does affect it. We also did have a couple of bluebirds in Q4. One was the revenue beat, and so that actually elevated the revenue a bit.\\nBut the other was when we signed the CHIPS agreement, we were able to take some of the grant and accrue it as kind of a benefit to cost of sales because it offset period expenses we had spent before. So, we weren't sure we were going to sign it in the fourth quarter, which is why I didn't guide that in the guidance from last quarter, but obviously, materializing that pushed the gross margins up for the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, I think what and we've kind of telegraphed this now for several quarters. Intel products gross margins are going to be under pressure this year.\\nSome of the parts have a higher cost, in particular, Lunar Lake has a higher cost, as you know, because it's got the memory and package. And so, we're basically buying that memory and turning around and selling it at the same price. So that's really weighing the margins down on Lunar Lake. So, margins for products are going to be under pressure pretty much throughout this year.\\nThen as Panther Lake comes in volume next year. more materially and in addition, the products beyond that, we'll start to see some improvement in margins on Intel products. Now that was always to be offset in a lot of ways by the margins of Intel foundry. We see more of a mix of EUV wafers.\\nThey have better pricing with a better cost. And so, we'll see a mixed improvement throughout the year. We're also reducing our spending there in period expenses as part of our kind of overall $10 billion-plus cost spending reduction. But it doesn't really show up in the first quarter.\\nIt's not until we get into the second and third quarter that we start to see that improvement show up. So those are really the bigger drivers of margins in the first quarter. It is a low point, as we talked about. The benefits are going to be really around margins improving on Intel foundry.\\nAs the mix of EU wafers increases throughout the year, in particular, as we get Panther Lake in there in the back half of the year, and we're selling 18A wafers at a higher margin. And then next year, we have Panther Lake with more volume and all those wafers start to come back, and that becomes a really big benefit to Intel overall.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question First question just on the segment guide for next quarter. Why are all three product segments down equally when it sounds like you've gotten more headwinds just on the surface of PC's inventory digestion and maybe the roll-off of some of that tariff pull forward? What's going on in the data center and the NEX businesses that makes them as bad as a client into Q1?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nWell, broadly across all markets, and we didn't necessarily telegraph every market in terms of where we think. But I'd say broadly, we're a little bit cautious on the macro and that affects all markets. In addition, seasonality does play in most of the markets, and that does impact the first quarter as well. So, I would say a combination of just macro uncertainty combined with kind of typical seasonality across all the businesses.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nStacy, do you have a follow-up question?\\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\\nYeah, I do. Thank you. So, you also talked about increased competitiveness weighing on margins at least into Q1. So again, I presume that's a question on pricing.\\nI guess, is that right? Do you expect that to persist through the year? And how do you think about that competitiveness, potentially weighing on pricing across client and especially in the data center?\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nYes, OK. So, the co-CEOs are trying to figure out who should answer OK, go ahead, Michelle.\\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\\nI think whoever wants to take it.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nYeah.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThe way I look at that is we do have increased competition as we see new market entrants particularly come into CCG. We've got a very good product in Lunar Lake there, but as Dave talked about, the margins on that product are more pressured based on the cost of the product. But we are going to stem the market segment share decline in client, and we're going to go after winning every socket. That mirrors itself when you think about the data center market as well.\\nAs I said, Granite Rapids is a very positive step in a competitive direction, but we have to stem the tide of share loss in data center. And so, we will be fighting for every socket in that business. And the way I look at it is we need to be aggressive. We need to win share, and we need to show our customers that they can win with us.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly, and our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\\nYes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question under your new co-leadership. I would be curious to hear how your strategy has potentially evolved specifically for IFS.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nI mean I think, and we've talked about this over the last couple of quarters. For one, we are not looking to spend ahead of success. And so, you saw our capex guide come down from the 20 to 23 range down to 20, that's in support of that strategy. We want to absolutely wow the customers.\\nBut to do that, we've got to be very careful around what we're promising them as well. So, I think what you'll see a lot of is a little bit more conservatism around how we deploy capital, how we engage with customers. We want to be doing more than what we promised to every turn, to every stakeholder, including investors, including customers, including suppliers, so what have you? That's pretty much the strategy. The main goal of building a world-class foundry, that's still in place.\\nWe feel that there absolutely is a need for another player in the leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing space. In particular, in the U.S., it aligns with the government the U.S. government's interest as well. So, we're absolutely committed to that.\\nIt's now about being very cautious and careful around generating the best ROIC for the shareholders.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nC.J., do you have a follow-up question?\\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\\nI do, thanks. I guess, Dave, another question for you. I believe that three months ago, the stated goal for 2025 was to be free cash flow positive, I guess, given kind of the weakness we're seeing in Q1 and uncertainty, can you kind of walk through how you're thinking about the path to turning free cash flow positive?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, we're not obviously guiding beyond the first quarter. But I would just say, we did a very good job in a challenging situation in '24 around cash flow from operations by driving strong working capital improvements, and we adjusted capex accordingly, and that helped stem the tide. So, while we were negative in '24, we were closer to zero than we should have been based on the top line results.\\nI'd say it's more about the same in '25. We're going to be acutely focused on cash flow from operations, really managing working capital effectively. We adjusted the capex down, as I talked about in relationship to a different outlook. We do expect some pretty significant offsets as well more than $10 billion of offsets, which will also help.\\nI won't throw out a number yet for adjusted free cash flow for the year, but I would just say that it's a focus that where we want to improve. I would say in addition to that, we have these noncore businesses, and we see opportunity to monetize there. That will help us deliver because that's a focus of us, the focus of ours in 2025. We are far along on the process of Altera.\\nI suspect that by the time we get to earnings next quarter, we'll have something to say there that will help generate some cash that we can use to deliver.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Jonathan. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\\nJoe Moore -- Analyst\\nGreat, thank you. In the prepared remarks, you made reference to the sort of tempering of expectations of Falcon Shores. Can you talk about what was behind that? And kind of what does it take for you to get competitive in that space?\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, of course, I can, Joe. I think it really comes down to taking the time over the last six weeks to actively engage with the teams, look at our road maps, look at where we are from a competitive perspective and from an execution perspective, and that really resulted in that decision. A lot of conversations with my customers as well in regards to what they see is needed to be competitive and to deliver the right product. And so, when I looked at that, obviously, we have our Gaudi product, we're learning a lot from that.\\nBut one of the things that we've learned from Gaudi is it's not enough to just deliver the silicon. We need to be able to deliver a complete rack scale solution, and that's what we're going to be able to do with falcon excuse me, with Jaguar Shores. Falcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system, networking memory, all the component functions of that, but what customers really want is that full-scale rack solution. And so, we're able to get to that with Jaguar Shores.\\nI think we've also seen a lot this week with DeepSeek and a lot of the excitement around not one size fits all. And so, I'm also trying to look at the road map to say there's a lot of IP and assets that we have at Intel Product co that we can leverage to address this market. We've got great CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, FPGAs, and we need to figure out how we harness those because if we've seen anything this week, when there are constraints put on customers, they figure out different ways to deploy technology. And so that's also a great opportunity and something that I'm looking at and looking at if there's ways that we can be disruptive there.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nJoe, do you have a follow-up question?\\nJoe Moore -- Analyst\\nI do. And thank you for your candor about all of that. I think separately, you mentioned in his prepared remarks about potentially seeing tariffs driving some pull forward. Can you just talk about how pervasive that might be? Is that conservatism that, that might be happening? You're seeing evidence that's happening? Just some color on where that's coming from.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. I mean, we obviously have a fairly good sense of what customers need from quarter to quarter. And in a couple of instances, customers ordered more than we think they were digesting. And so, it was really just the analytics that gave us insight into, they're doing that for a reason, and we know tariffs are big subject of a lot of our customers.\\nIt was in the region you might expect in the Asian region that we saw this. It's hard for me to extrapolate this beyond this quarter. A lot not known yet around what might be the plans on tariffs. I just thought it was a little bit of hedging going on by customers that pulled revenue into the fourth quarter and away from the first quarter.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\\nThanks a lot. Dave, I also wanted to ask about gross margin. I think the message you were saying is that it's kind of 60% incremental, and that was kind of off of the 39.5 that you guided for Q4, but obviously, you came in, you had these one-timers and now we're down to March. So, can you just sort of level set us for kind of how to think of the incrementals from here?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nIncrementals from Q1 in other words, into Q2, 3, and 4. Is that what you're saying?\\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\\nYes. Yes. Just kind of like, is it off of 3.95%? Is it off of 3.65%.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeagh. The rule of thumb has generally been 60% in this period of what I call catch-up. Obviously, we think we can do better fall-through as we get more stabilized. The one dynamic in '25 is this kind of margin pressure around product like Lunar Lake.\\nThat probably pulls the range down to probably something more like in the 40% to 60% fall-through is probably the right way to think about it just for that dynamic. Now we get into '26 and you start to see a lot more 18A volume through Panther Lake, I think we're in the 60%-plus range at that level.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nTim, do you have a follow-up question?\\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\\nI do. Yeah, Dave, also, so you took the capex to the low end, but there's $1.2 billion outflow that's in the financing section of the cash flow statement. What is that? I guess I'm trying to figure out just on an apples-to-apples basis, is like capex really coming down this year? And is that a line item in the financing section, is that going to keep getting bigger this year? Thanks.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. No let's see, let me go back on the capex. If you look at capex for '25, the $20 billion forecast, what's driving that lower is really a function of better utilizing assets under construction. So, our philosophy has been to invest kind of ahead of what was required, and we built up a pretty significant balance in assets under construction, I mean, to the tune of greater than $50 billion.\\nSo, we actually have a lot of capital on the balance sheet that really hasn't been deployed. And so, what we pushed the teams to do in an effort to drive better ROA and return on invested capital is to have them digest as much as that as possible and limit the amount of purchases that we make externally. And that's going to allow us to get down to the $20 billion range. I would be, we're not doing any funky financing around this, but I would be in the spirit of transparency, say that capex is two things, right? It's what you place in terms of orders on equipment, and it's when you give them the cash.\\nAnd so, for sure, we are working the payment terms of suppliers to improve our -- to improve our capex, lower our capex, that is pushing spend out even as we're getting the assets in. But quite honestly, by the time we've actually deployed it and it's depreciating, we've actually, in all cases, I think, spent the money because it goes on to assets under construction and probably hangs in there for like nine months before it's ever deployed.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\\nVivek Arya -- Analyst\\nThanks for taking my question. First kind of related questions are on the data center server CPU market. MJ, I'm curious, when you look at Intel versus your x86 competitor, do you think these share gains are because of better design or access to better manufacturing? And so, what can be fixed and what will take time to fix or if you were to outsource more, right, to external foundry does that help you regain share, and I imagine that applies more to cloud. And then on the enterprise side, have you seen any share shifts at all over the last few years?\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Vivek. Well, as you look at data center and the competitiveness, as I said and stated earlier, Granite Rapids did a good job of making a good first step in closing the gap versus competition, but we still have a gap. And so, we've got to be laser-focused next on delivering diamond rapids. And the feedback for both of those products early is very positive.\\nWhen it comes to external manufacturing, I've been pretty transparent about this in the way I think about it in my philosophy. The way I look at it is you have to have the right product at the right process and you have to deliver that within the right market window. If you look at Intel's overall today, we do about 30% of our manufacturing externally across a variety of partners. That's probably the high for where we are today, but it will never be zero.\\nWhat I can tell you is 18A is going well. They earn my business, obviously, both for Panther Lake and for Clearwater Forest. But as I think about being more competitive in data center moving forward and I look at future designs, I will ask myself that question every time as we look at the road map. So, I think it would not be unfathomable that I would put a data center product outside.\\nIf that meant that I hit the right product, the right market window, as well as the right performance for my customers.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nVivek, do you have a follow-up question?\\nVivek Arya -- Analyst\\nYes. Thank you, John. So maybe one for Dave on this noncontrolling interest. I think David said $500 million to $700 million for this year, so a little bit lower than I think the $700 million you had before.\\nBut then it starts to grow to $1.2 billion or $1.4 billion. Is this always going to keep on increasing, right? Like what is the right way for us to model it because the less you outsource. I guess the more you insource, the more you give to a foundry, the more reversals, right, you have to do on this NCI part, I would imagine. So, is it a reasonable way to model how much of a headwind this is to your reported EPS?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, it's a good question. I mean, just to break it all out, it's more than just the SCIPs. SCIP 1 and 2 are obviously in there, but also Mobileye shows up in noncontrolling interest. And as we sell down stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera, it actually exacerbates that NCI.\\nSo, Altera doesn't have any NCI, but as soon as we sell a stake, it is going to have NCI. So, there are a number of things that go into it, which makes it a little bit difficult to forecast because you have to kind of know, you have to know two things with certainty, one, exactly what share of every asset you have? And two, what your production is going to look like in the fabs that you have these skips. So, what we felt comfortable was, was guiding guiding '25 and giving you an indication for '26, it's likely to go up in '27. But I think it's probably too soon to actually identify what the exact number will look like.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius. Your question, please.\\nBen Reitzes -- Analyst\\nDave and MJ, I wanted to, I know in your prepared remarks, you said you look forward to working with the Trump administration. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about your initial talks with them. Have they reached out? And who's like leading the discussions from your side? And any color on what you're exactly talking about and what they're particularly interested in? I mean Howard Lutnick, obviously, it sounds like this is very near and dear to him during his confirmation hearings and would love to just kind of get a little bit more color on where you, what you have done so far and where you think it's going? And then I'll have a follow-up.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. OK. Thanks, Ben. Maybe I'll take that as the co-CEO.\\nyes, we have good engagement with them. We've really been engaged since the election, with the team at various levels, obviously, at the CEO level, but also, we have a strong government affairs team that engages with them every day. I feel really good about their outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. I think this is a very positive sign, obviously, for us.\\nQuite honestly, we never left the U.S. So, we're in a kind of the pull position in that regard. And I think they understand the value of doing R&D in the U.S. for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, which also is positive.\\nThey want to see more jobs coming back to the U.S. We pay high wage, high-tech jobs. So that's obviously positive for them. But more importantly, this is about security, both in terms of just the supply chain but also in kind of secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense, which we're obviously in a position to do for them.\\nI imagine that as we progress, we'll be more engaged with them to make this a reality. And both Michelle and I will be meeting fairly regularly with the Trump administration officials to go make their goals or reality for the U.S.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nBen, you said you had a follow-up?\\nBen Reitzes -- Analyst\\nI wanted to double-click on a prior question on gross margins and ask it a little bit more in caveman terms rather than incremental. You talked about being the bottom. I'm trying to figure out how high it goes sequentially as we go throughout the year, given it sounds like you're going to be a lot more price aggressive in server CPUs and client CPUs from what I heard. So, in addition to, I'm trying to balance that with the thought of outsourcing more to TSMC for the year, etc.\\nSo, if that's the low point. I guess what I'm trying to say, can you be more prescriptive in light of that pricing comment I made and if it's right, then just give us a little more color on where we go from the 1Q, that would be great.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, I mean, we tend to be competitive in the product space. And also, as I mentioned, the cost structure is under some pressure, in particular because of Lunar Lake. So that absolutely will impact the gross margins on products. There won't be a lot of lift in that business unit through the year.\\nAnd it's really not until Panther Lake comes that they, I think, start to see some better cost structure and have a part that's very competitive that I think allows us to perhaps even relax some of that pressure in a competitive market. That said, the foundry business will see improvements. Over the course of the year, more wafers will be coming back. With Panther Lake, it becomes even better in the following year.\\nWe are improving the cost structure of the foundry business as part of our overall spending reduction plan. So, that will also help. And then just keep in mind, these wafers that we're producing at Intel and 18A have much better cost structure and margin structure relative, I should say, relative to the price structure than their predecessors and that will be beneficial on the foundry side. So, in the caveman macro sense, I think the best thing to do is probably take this like somewhere in the 40% to 60% fall-through and that's probably the right rough-order math to get you to where the margins will go in any quarter based on what you're projecting the revenue to be in that quarter.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to build off of that last question a little bit. During the prepared remarks, you had mentioned 1% in 2023 with EUV wafer mix and that progressed to north of 5% this year. Can you give us a framework of how you would define success looking through 2025, maybe exiting the year as far as EUV wafer mix? And remind us again what the delta is in terms of cost structure, the margin dynamics of an EUV wafer.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Well, I'll say on the second part, maybe I'll answer that one first. I would say the price on those wafers goes up at 3x the cost of those -- sorry, maybe said, the blended ASP and cost goes up 3x as you go to 18A versus the cost. So, it's a pretty dramatic improvement in gross margins as you move into 18A versus pre-EUV wafers.\\nProbably, it'd be tough for me to hazard a guess on exactly how we'll exit the year in terms of our percentage of EUV. It's definitely going to go up. You know branded is on Intel 3, Panther Lake is on Meteor Lake is on Intel 3 or 4, 4 and 3 node. Panther Lake is on 18A this year.\\nSo, we'll see a pretty meaningful jump in the percentage of wafers that will be EUV as we exit '25.\\nRoss Seymore -- Analyst\\nAaron, do we have a follow-up question?\\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\\nI do, and it's probably a dumb question, but I'm just going to ask it because I'm just a little confused that the SCIP impact, this $500 million to $700 million going to $1.2 billion. Just remind us again, so we're all clear that when you report EPS on a non-GAAP basis, that's in that EPS number, just so we -- I'm modeling it correctly. I'm sure my peers are already, but I want to make sure I've got that all clear in my head.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nI just want to be clear. It's not just SCIP. I mean that includes the Mobileye income and will include the Altera income to some extent. But yes, all of that in the NCI, we do take it against our non-GAAP number to get our fully diluted non-GAAP EPS number.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nAaron, thank you. Jonathan, we have time for one more question.\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\\nSrini Pajjuri -- Analyst\\nThank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, on the foundry breakeven, I guess, target for 2027. Maybe can you talk about what are the assumptions behind that? I mean do you think you can get there with mostly internal wafers? Or do you need external customers as well? If so, what sort of revenue do we need from external customers to, I guess, achieve that breakeven?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So, we're still aiming to get to breakeven in 2017, as you pointed out. It's really on the back of internal wafers or wafers from Intel products, I should say. And it's obviously, a lot based on EUV wafers, which carry a better margin.\\nAnd as that mix improves, that significantly improves the margins. But more importantly, I think the original premise by creating this different P&L structure was to drive the foundry business really at that point was just a function of manufacturing to be more focused on efficiency, to squeeze out more from the existing footprint, to be more sensitive to capital and ultimately, just think about ROIC in everything they do, and I think that has worked actually. I mean I hear it all the time. It's amazing the transformation we've seen in staff meetings, and Michelle and I attended that, they're completely pivoted to how to make money in that business.\\nAnd so, I think it's working. I think we'll see significantly more efficiency as we go into work through '25 and into '26. So, I feel good about our ability to get to breakeven. Obviously, we want to have external customers.\\nAnd so, we have some very small amount that we've assumed for '27. But if 18A looks like it's something that hunts based on feedback from customers. And I feel like we will probably outperform in that regard in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers. So those are all the factors that I think will drive '27 to profitability.\\nAnd ultimately, obviously, we want to get to push to breakeven and ultimately, we want to get the business to a profitable level that's consistent with what the foundry industry gets.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nSrini, do you have a quick follow-on?\\nSrini Pajjuri -- Analyst\\nYes. A quick one. So, on the 18A Panther Lake, I think in the past, I think, Dave, the comment was that you expect to bring roughly 70% of the die in-house. Is that still the plan? And then is it pretty set in stone that you're bringing it back for sure? Or do you have any flexibility whether to bring back more of the die or less of the die if you need to.\\nSo just trying to understand.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nI'm going to let Michelle answer that because it really is her decision on how she builds her products.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. So, we did move Panther Lake inside of 18A design win. But as I stated before, we look at each generation of products based on what's the right product, what's the right process, what's the right market window and what allows our customers to win. So, for Panther Lake, that was 18A.\\nAnd as I said, we're very happy with where we are from a performance and yield perspective at this point in the process. So, that will stay on 18A. Then as you look forward, to our next-generation product for client after that, Nova Lake will actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So, you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside.\\nAgain, it's about optimizing to what allows us to win in the market, what allows us to win with our customers and optimizing the overall product portfolio because at the end of the day, if our customers are successful, we win, that drives more wafers and Intel foundry and that allows us to win, but I'll continue to have a balance. And as I said, we'll be doing the same look across our data center portfolio as well.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nGreat. Thanks, Michelle. So, with that, let me wrap up by saying thank you, as always, for joining the call. MJ and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress and the actions we've taken.\\nQ4 was a good step forward, obviously, but we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, and we're looking forward to updating you as we go along. We hope to see many of you in person at the investors conferences we'll be attending in Q1. And I'd also like to highlight that the Intel foundry team will be hosting their second annual Direct Connect User event on April 29th in San Jose, and we hope many of you will join that in person. So, thank you, and good night.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\nDuration: 0 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nDavid A.

today's program Mr John Pitzer corporate vice president vest relations please go ahead thank you Jonathan and good afternoon to everyone joining us today by now you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation both of which are available on our investor relations website inc.com for those joining us online today the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window I'm joined today by our inm Co CEO Michelle Johnson Holt house and Dave zinner as you know Michelle is also CEO of Intel products and Dave continues to serve as Intel CFO in a few moments Michelle will open up with some summary comments before providing more detail on Intel products Dave will then discuss Intel Foundry and the overall financials including our q1 guidance before we begin please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties it also contains references to non-gaap financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors our earnings release most recent annual report on form 10K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations they also provide additional information on our non-gaap fincial measures including reconciliations were appropriate to our corresponding Gap Financial measures with that let me turn things over to Michelle thank you John and let me add my welcome it's been roughly two months since Dave and I stepped into our roles as interim co-ceos from day one we had been working closely together alongside the board to drive better execution of our strategy there are no quick fixes and we are committed to improving our performance and rebuilding our credibility through persistent hard work that delivers tangible results as part of this we are driving more focused Investments across the business we cannot be all things to all people and we are prioritizing areas where we can drive differentiated value we are also continuing to simplify our business and become a leaner more efficient company and most of all we are doing a better job of listening to our customers to ensure we meet their needs Q4 was a step in the right direction we delivered Revenue gross margin and EPS above our guide Intel products executed to drive Revenue in the quarter even as PC inventory continued to normalize and Intel Foundry drove incremental operating efficiencies while achieving key Grant related Milestones which supported solid upside to gross margins as co-ceos you can expect us to be very straightforward and direct we only make commitments we are confident we can deliver we firmly believe that what we say is not nearly as important as what we do and everything we do must be in service of our customers innovating to solve their most pressing challenges is the shest path to creating shareholder value this is the mindset I have brought to my position as the CEO of Intel products this is a great business with great people partners and IP to design worldclass products from Edge to Cloud I take nothing for granted but I firmly believe that the core x86 architecture and the ecosystems we have built and invested in over the decades create a solid foundation for Success our customers share this view but they need us to improve our execution and hit our commitments I am setting clear priorities and directions in each business to drive better outcomes I think about Intel products in three buckets first client Edge second traditional Data Center and third the AI data center let me spend a few moments on each in client Intel CPUs power roughly seven out of every 10 PCS this is a strong position that gives us advantages in the market that said the market is becoming more competitive especially as we see new entrance trying to participate in the AIP category personally I thrive on competition it drives a healthy paranoia across everything we do and we're using it as motivation to up our game even more the success of core Ultra across meteor Lake AOL Lake and lunar lake has established Intel as the market leader in aipc CPUs and we remain on track to ship more than a 100 million cumulative systems by the end of 2025 we are inov in at scale unlike any of our competitors this was on display earlier this month at CES where we launched the Enterprise versions of our AIC CPUs with compelling new features to Intel vpro this is a testament to the strong ecosystem we have built with it departments around manageability security trust and brand and we expect these Investments to possession us well as corporations begin their migration to Windows 11 along onside our investments in Enterprise our ecosystem reach also positions us well in the aipc consumer markets we are working with more than 200 isvs across more than 400 features to optimize their software on our silicon I'm excited about the new applications I'm seeing in the pipeline that will begin to proliferate over the coming months our goal is to innovate partner and fortify our position as the preferred CPU of choice looking ahead to the rest of the year we will strengthen our client road mapap with the launch of Panther Lake our lead product on Intel 18a in the second half of 2025 as the first volume customer of Intel 18a I see the progress that Intel foundary is making on performance and yields and I look forward to being in production in the second half as we demonstrate the benefits of our world-class design and process technology capabilities 2026 is even more more exciting from a client perspective as Panther Lake achieves meaningful volumes and we introduce our next Generation client Family Code named Nova Lake both will provide strong performance across the entire PC stack with significantly better costs and margins for us enhancing our competitive position and reinforcing our value proposition to our partners and customers let me now turn to our traditional Data Center business the team has made good progress toward toward strengthening our offerings and driving better more predictable execution this year is all about improving zeon's competitive position as we fight harder to close the gap to competition the ramp of granite Rapids has been a good first step we are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest our first Intel 18a server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year all of this provides a strong foundation on which to build as we execute the world's data center workloads still primarily run on Intel silicon and we have a strong ecosystem especially within Enterprise we are going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025 one of the ways we'll do this is by re-engaging the x86 ecosystem we have seen a positive response from the x86 ecosystem Advisory Group we formed last fall and we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for building both semi-custom and custom products this is a big area of opportunity for the business and we look forward to talking more about this as we have news to share turning to the AI data center I will start by saying that this is an attractive market for us over time but I am not happy with where we are today on the one hand we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers and we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU based inference on Prem and at the end Edge as AI infused applications proliferate on the other hand we're not yet participating in the cloud-based AI Data Center Market in a meaningful way we have learned a lot as we have ramped gouty and we are applying those learnings going forward one of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our road map and concentrate our resources many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month based on industry feedback we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to Market this will support our efforts to develop a system level solution at Rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center more broadly as I think about our AI opportunity my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve most notably the need to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute AI is not a market in the traditional sense it's an enabling application that needs to span across the compute continuum from data center to the edge as such a one siiz fits-all approach will not work and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core Assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the Continuum before I turn the call over to Dave let me close by speaking as Intel foundry's largest wafer customer I have a pretty simple approach when we are able to combine worldclass products with worldclass process technology we win as as CEO of Intel products I will always make processed technology decisions based on what is best for my customers an Intel foundary will need to earn my business every day just as I need to earn the business of my customers having said that I'm confident in Intel foundaries team ability to support my current and future product roadmap and I'm excited to do more business with them as their process technology continues to advance a stronger Intel products combined with a more competitive Intel family is a recipe for success for Intel overall Dave over to you thanks Michelle let me add my welcome I'm going to address three topics today update on Intel Foundry second Q4 and full year financials and third our q1 guidance starting with Intel Foundry I've had an opportunity to meet with a number of our partners and potential customers for Intel Foundry over the last couple months I come away from those meetings encouraged by the opportunity we have in front of us and I've received clear feedback on what our customers need from us to succeed this starts with our execution on Intel ATA this has been an area of good progress like any new process there have been puts and takes along the way but overall we're confident that we are delivering a competitive process we're excited by the launch of Panther Lake this year and the internal ramp of Intel 18a in the second half that will support increased volumes and improved profitability in 2026 from the perspective of external customers Intel 18a is a very competitive offering that gives each of them a reason to engage with us however Foundry winds are about more than just technology trust is also a significant factor customers must believe you can execute consistently and be willing to invest in IP to Port a design to a new Foundry that's why past transitions in the industry have generally started with customers giving new Foundry Partners smaller volumes then gradually increasing as trust grows we've made good progress but to accelerate this I'm asking the team to redouble their efforts on ease of porting IP availability and best known Foundry methods I'm particularly pleased by the willingness of our suppliers and partners to engage with us augmenting our expertise and hard work with theirs job number one is earning the customer trust the Intel 18a design wins to date provide good validation of the strategy and we continue to have a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers but we won't win every deal out of the gates we'll be selective and focused on areas where we are confident that we can be a meaningful contributor to the success of our customer and we look forward to updating you as rfqs become wins in addition we continue to have good momentum in advanced packaging and in our collaboration with Tower semiconductor and UMC all three are critical to utilize our assets longer for higher rates of return this is a good segue into my other key areas of focus for Intel Foundry improving our financials and making sure that we're deploying your Capital appropriately at roughly 181 billion in Revenue Intel Foundry today is larger than all but one external Foundry that's clearly not reflected on our p&l with negative gross margins and a greater than \\$1 13 billion operating loss in 2024 we're going to systematically attack our costs and remain highly focused on our goal of delivering Break Even operating income for Intel Foundry by the end of 2027 and we expect to demonstrate improvements this year the financial benefits of Shifting our wafer volume from Intel 7 to Intel 18a along with learning to run our Fabs more efficiently and our process nodes longer will be important drivers of improving our financials Beyond 2027 we need to drive to cash flow from operations that supports our Capital spending needs and ultimately generate a great return on your capital I remain very optimistic on our opportunity in at Intel Foundry the pervasive growth of AI is driving accelerating and unprecedented demand for silicon and there continues to be an unmet need for greater choice and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry today tsmc is a valued supplier to Intel products and important partner to IMS and they've established a very high standard for what it takes to be a worldclass foundary but the market overall needs multiple players and as we execute Intel Foundry has a very important role to play globally and especially here in the us where we continue to invest in Leading Edge R&D and Manufacturing capacity we're also pleased to sign with the US Department of Commerce a definitive agreement awarding us up to \\$ 7.86 billion in Grants as you know these grants are Milestone based and we have already received \\$1.1 billion in Q4 and have received an additional \\$1.1 billion in January of q1 in addition we continue to make good progress building out our secure Enclave in partnership with the Department of Defense we look forward to continued engagement with the Trump Administration as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen us Technology and Manufacturing leadership finally as you will recall we announced Our intention to establish an independent subsidiary structure for Intel Foundry to provide clear governance and operational separation this structure also enables us to seek additional funding options from both strategic and Financial Partners which we are now actively beginning to explore let me now turn to our Consolidated Financial results and q1 guidance 14.3 billion up 7% sequentially and at the high end of the range we provided in October as a result of solid growth in ccg equipment sales at Ms and the edge business of NX non-gaap gross margin came in at 42.1% 260 basis points ahead of guidance on higher Revenue better costs and the receipt of our first chips Grant offset partially by inventory reserves related to gouty we delivered fourth quarter earnings per share of 13 cents versus our guidance of 12 cents higher Revenue stronger gross margin and improved operating leverage was offset by lower interest and income which includes an acral related to our second skip agreement of roughly \\$750 million reflecting an an adjustment in our planned capacity ramp in Ireland in Q2 we began the process of resizing our expense structure to support more modest long-term growth including adjusting our capacity plans to more conservative levels driving impairments in Q3 and this acral in Q4 Q4 operating cash flow was positive \\$3.2 billion down approximately \\$900 million sequentially due to the cash outlays associated with our Q3 restructuring charges we had gross capb backs of \\$6.3 billion with offsets of \\$1.6 billion in the quarter resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative \\$1.5 billion as I mentioned earlier we also received a portion of the chips grants this quarter for the full year revenue is \\$ 53.1 billion down 2.1% year-over-year modest year-over-year growth in Intel products was more than offset by lower Revenue at Mobil ey and Altera as well as the forecasted decline in Foundry Services due to the end of life on traditional packaging Revenue full year gross margin was 36% and down 760 basis points due to Q3 impairments lower revenue and inventory impacts full year EPS was minus33 and down \\$118 on Lower Revenue lower gross margin and higher period charges we generated \\$8.3 billion in cash from operations made \\$24 billion of gross Capital Investments and generated capital offsets of approximately 13.4 billion from skip partner contributions and government grants and incentives as a result adjusted free cash flow was minus \\$2.2 billion and we ended the year with \\$22.1 billion of cash and short-term Investments moving to segment results for Q4 Intel products Revenue was \\$13 billion up 7% sequentially ccg Revenue was up 9% quarter over quarter as the rate at which our customers digested inventory slowed meaningfully from Q3 while difficult to quantify we suspect a portion of Q4 Revenue upside was due to customers hedging against potential tariffs DCI Revenue was up slightly sequentially off a better than expected Q3 as demand for traditional servers remained stable revenue for nexx was up 7.5% sequentially and is now up more than 20% from Q2 lows as customers are returning to more normal buying patterns especially in our Edge business operating profit for Intel products was \\$3.6 billion 28% of Revenue Vue and up \\$300 million quarter over quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses Intel Foundry delivered revenue of \\$4.5 billion up 3% sequentially on increased euv wafer mix and higher equipment sales by IMS euv wafer Revenue Grew From 1% of total revenue in 2023 to greater than 5% in 2024 Intel Foundry operating loss in Q4 of \\$2.3 billion improved meaningfully sequentially as Q3 was impacted by \\$3.1 billion of impairments excluding impairments operating loss would have been roughly flat quarter on quarter turning to all other mobile ey reported revenue of \\$490 million up 1% sequentially with operating profit of \\$103 million and earlier today guided for full year 2025 increases to both revenue and operating income Altera delivered revenue of \\$429 million up 4% sequentially operating margin was 21% versus 2% in Q3 on better gross margins and operating leverage for q1 we expect Altera Revenue to be down sequentially less than overall Intel Consolidated we continue to make good progress on the stake sale of Altera and see a path for an IPO in the coming years now turning to guidance q1 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter of the Year down high single to low double digits percentage sequentially on average in addition we see added pressure coming from macro uncertainty especially around tariffs balancing of PC inventory and increasing competition these mitigating factors support a more tempered Revenue Outlook as we come into the new year as a result we're forecasting a revenue range of 11.7 to 12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025 down between 11 to 18% sequentially within Intel product we expect Revenue to decline across all three of our segments at roughly similar rates we expect Intel Foundry Revenue roughly flat to down modestly quarter over quarter helped by continued mix shift to euv Wafers Intel 18a samples and advanced packaging at the midpoint of 12.2 billion we expect gross margin of approximately 36% with a tax rate of 12% and break even EPS all on a non-gaap basis let me take a few moments to provide some commentary that may be helpful for your full year 2025 modeling at the Consolidated level we expect gross margin to improve from q1 Intel products gross margin was 51% in 2024 and is expected to decline this year due to product mix in both ccg and DCI Intel founder gross margin will improve on euv mix shift and growth in advanced packaging despite expected depreciation growth in 2025 of roughly 10% we continue to Target 2025 opcs of\\$ 17.5 billion with further reductions in 2026 we expect non-controlled income or NCI to net to roughly zero in q1 and be in the range of 500 to 700 million impact this year on a gap basis NCI is expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 to a range of 1.2 to \\$1.4 billion on a gap basis and increase further in future years as we increase we for routs at our Fabs where we have agreements with skip Partners we anticipate that our 2025 gross Capital investments will be approximately 20 billion at the low end of our previous guide of 20 to2 23 billion reflecting further capacity adjustments to Ohio and Ireland as well as better utilization of what we call our Construction in progress specifically we invested ahead of demand over the past few years and these capital investments will enable us to meet expected demand at a lower level of spending as we drive to more efficiently deploy our Capital we expect 2025 net capex of 8 to 11 billion with roughly half of the offsets expected to come from government incentives and tax credits and half from partner contributions delivering in 2025 remains a top priority for us on Lower capex increased cash from operations and value unlock across our non-core assets finally I'll will remind you that we will provide new segment reporting in conjunction with our q1 earnings we expect to make further changes to our segments including moving the edge portion of NX into ccg and our auto business from all other into ccg in addition we expect to move the networking portion of anex which includes Zeon sales into DCI and the IMs equipment business out of Intel Foundry into all other I'll wrap up by saying that Q4 was a solid quarter to close out a challenging year with that said our profitability is below where it needs to be and we must enhance our competitive position in the market Michelle and I will continue taking actions to improve the operational and financial trajectory of the business we'll remain focused on building a stronger Intel products business and becoming a more efficient Intel Foundry and by driving continued progress in these areas we're confident in our ability to unlock value for our stakeholders before you the line to questions it's worth mentioning that the board remains intensely focused on the search for a permanent CEO the search is progressing but we have nothing new to report and won't be able to add additional information on this topic today with that I'll turn it over to John to start the Q&A thank you Dave we will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call as a reminder we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable with Jonathan can we take the first question please certainly and our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank your question please hi guys thanks for me ask a question I guess the first one would be for MJ you talked about no quick fixes uh but a lot of things to improve the road map specifically on the DCI side of things can you talk about how much you think Granite is closing the Gap it sounds like clear waterer Forest has not mentioned nearly as much as far as a 2025 event neither from launch or from a revenue perspective so if there's any updates on that and then just overall what it's going to take uh and when do you think we will be able to externally see that Gap close versus competitors sure thanks for the question Ross um I look at it this way so when I talk about no quick fixes I think it's going to be one to two years of consistent execution and continuing to see better products each year really to bring our customers back to the table and be excited about Intel road map Granite Rapids is a good first step in doing that it does close the gap our customers are excited about it and we are starting to see the competitiveness of that product materialize in volume but I'm also very cleare eyed about where we stand and so we've just got to see that continued throughout 26 when we get to Diamond Rapids Etc so you also asked me about Clearwater Forest so I really look at the data center Market in kind of two buckets we have our PE Corp products which you know is granite Rapids and then we have our EC cor products which equates to Clear Water forest and what we've seen is that's more of a niche market and we haven't seen volume materialized there as fast as we expected but as we look at Clear Water Forest we expect that to come to Market in the first half of 2026 18a is doing just fine on its performance and yields for granite Rapids but it does have some complicated pack packaging um expectations that move it to 2026 um but we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well but this is going to be a journey it's not a destination Ross do you have a follow-up question yeah switching over to Dave on the profitability side uh can you just walk us through some of the puts in takes on the gross margin sequentially in the first quarter obviously revenues are down but anything else and then you mentioned that it would be the low point of the year the gross margin in the first quarter but uh what would be the headwinds and Tailwinds as you think through 2025 as a whole on that metric thank you yeah thanks Ross um okay so for the first quarter the biggest obvious contributor to gross margins uh sequentially is the revenue decline um you know at the midpoint we're declining a little over \\$2 billion doar and So that obviously you know on a mostly fixed cost business that does affect it we also did have a couple of bluebirds uh in Q4 one was the revenue beat and so that actually elevated the revenue a bit but the other was when we signed the chips uh agreement uh we were able to take some of the Grant and acre it as uh you know kind of a benefit to cost of sales because it it offset period expenses we had spent uh before so uh I we weren't sure we were going to sign it in the fourth quarter which is why I didn't guide that in the uh in the guidance from last quarter but you know obviously materialized and that pushed the gross margins up for the fourth quarter um in the first quarter I think you know what and we've kind of tell graph this now for several quarters you know Intel products gross margins are going to be under pressure this year uh some of the parts have a higher cost in particular lunar lake has a higher cost uh as you know because it's got the memory in package and so you know we're basically buying that memory and turning around and selling it at the same price that's really weighing the margins down on lunar lake so margins for products is going to be under pressure pretty much throughout this year then his Panther Lake comes you know in volume next year uh more materially and you know the in addition the products beyond that uh we'll start to see some improvement in margins on Intel products uh now that was always to off be offset in a lot of ways by the margins of Intel Foundry uh you know we see more of a mix of euv Wafers they have better pricing with a better cost and so we'll see a mix Improvement throughout the year we're also reducing our spending there in Period expenses with as part of our you know kind of overall \\$10 billion plus cost spending reduction but it doesn't really show up in the first quarter it's not until we get into the second and third quarter that we start to see uh that Improvement uh show up so those are really the bigger drivers of margins on the on the first quarter um it is a low Point as as we talked about you know the benefits are going to be really around you know margins improving on Intel Foundry uh as the mix of EU wavers uh increases throughout the year in particular as we get Panther Lake in there in the back half of the and we're selling uh 18a Wafers at a higher margin uh and um you know then next year we have Panther Lake in more volume and all those Wafers start to come back and that becomes a really big benefit uh to Intel overall thank you Ross Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasin from birnen research your question please hi guys thanks for taking my question um first question just on the segment guide for next quarter why are all three product segments down equally when it sounds like you've got more headwinds just on the surface of PCS inventory digestion and maybe the roll off of some of that tariff pull forward what's going on in the in the data center and the NX businesses that makes them as bad as a client in into q1 well broadly uh across all markets and we you know we didn't necessarily Telegraph every market in terms of where we think but i' say broadly you know we're we're a little bit cautious on the macro and that affects all markets uh in addition you know seasonality does play in most of the markets and that that does impact uh the first quarter as well so I would say you know combination of just macro uncertainty combined with uh you know kind of typical seasonality across all the businesses Jon do you have a follow-up question um yeah I do thank you um so you also talked about increased competitiveness Weighing on on margins at least into q1 so again I presume that's a question on pricing I guess is that right do you expect that to persist through the year and how do you think about that competitiveness potentially waiting on pricing across client and especially in in the in the data center yes okay so the co- CEOs are trying to figure out who should answer okay go ahead whoever want take it yeah um the way I look at that is we do have increased competition as we see New Market entrance particularly come in to ccg um we've got a very good product in lunar Lake there but as Dave talked about you know the margins on that product are more pressured based on the cost of the product but we are going to stem the market segment share decline in client and we're going to go after winning every socket that mirrors itself when you think about the data center Market as well as I said Granite Rapids is a very positive step in a competitive Direction but we have to stem the tide of share loss in Data Center and so we will be fighting for every socket in that business and the way I look at it is we need to be aggressive we need to win share and we need to show our customers that they can win with us thank you Stacy Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes from the line PJ muse from caner fitgerald your question please yeah good afternoon thank you for taking the question um I guess first question uh under your new co-leadership uh we'd be curious to hear um how your strategy um has potentially evolved specifically for IFS I mean I think uh and we've talked about this over the last couple quarters I mean for one we are not looking to spend ahead of success and so you know you saw our Capa guide come down from the 20 to 23 range down to 20 that's in in um you know in support of that uh that strategy uh you know we want to absolutely wow the customers but to do that we've got to be very careful around what we're promising them as well so I think what you'll see see a lot of is a little bit more conservatism around how we deploy Capital how we engage with customers we want to be doing more than what we promise uh to every turn to every stakeholder including investors including customers including suppliers so what have you that's pretty much the the the strategy the main goal of building a worldclass boundary that's still in place uh you know we we feel that there absolutely is a need for another player in the Leading Edge semiconductor manufact uring space in particular in the US it aligns with the government the US government's interests as well so we're we're absolutely committed to that it's now about being very cautious and careful around generating the best roic for the shareholders CJ do you have a follow-up question I do thanks um I guess Dave another question for you um I believe that you know three three months ago the the stated goal for 2025 was to be free cash flow positive I guess given kind of the weakness we're seeing in q1 and uncertainty can you kind of walk through how how you're thinking about um the path to Turning free cash flow positive yeah so we're we're not obviously guiding uh you know beyond the first quarter but I would just say we you know we we did a very good job in a challenging uh situation in 24 around c s from operations by driving strong working Capital Improvements and we adjusted capex accordingly and uh and that helped you know stem the tide so while we were negative in before uh you know we were closer to zero than we should have been based on the Topline results I'd say it's more about the same uh in 25 we're going to be cutely focused on cash flow from operations really managing working capital effectively uh we adjusted the capex down as I talked about uh in relationship to a different Outlook uh we do expect some pretty significant um uh offsets as well more than \\$10 billion of offsets which will also help uh you know I won't throw out a number yet for for adjusted free cash flow for the year but I would just say that it's a focus that we that we're where we want to improve I would say in addition to that you know we have these non-core businesses and we see opportunity to monetize there that will help us delever because that's a focus of us focus of ours in 2025 uh we are you know far along on the process of Altera uh I suspect that by the time we get earnings next next quarter we'll have something to say there that will help generate some cash that we can use to to delever thanks DJ Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley your question please great thank you um in the prepared remarks you made reference to the sort of tempering of expectations of Falcon Shores can you talk about you know the you know what was find that and kind of what does it take for you to get uh competitive in that space uh yeah of course I can Joe I think it really comes down to taking the time over the last six weeks to actively engage with the teams look at our road maps look at where we are from a competitive perspective and from an execution P perspective and that really resulted in that decision a lot of conversations with my customers as well in regards to what do they see is needed to be com competitive and to deliver the right product and so when I looked at that obviously we have our gouty product we're learning a lot from that but one of the things that we've learned from gouty is it's not enough to just deliver the Silicon we need to be able to deliver a complete rack scale solution and that's what we're going to be able to do with Falcon excuse me with Jaguar Shores Falcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system networking memory all the component functions of that but what customers really want is that full scale rack solution and so we're able to get to that with Jaguar Shores I think we've ALS seen a lot this week with deep seek and a lot of the excitement around not one size fits all and so I'm also trying to look at the road map to say there's a lot of Ip and assets that we have as Intel product Co that we can leverage to address this market we've got great CPUs gpus as6 fpgas and we need to figure out how we harness those because if we've seen anything this week when there are constraints put on customers they figure out different ways to deploy technology and so that's also a great opportunity and something that I'm looking at and looking at if there's ways that we can be disruptive there Joe do you have a follow-up question I do and and thank you for your cander about all of that I think I separately you mentioned in the prepared remarks about you know potentially seeing tffs driving some some pull forward can you just talk about you know how pervasive that might be is that conservatism that that might be happening are you seeing evidence that that's happening just some color on on where that's coming from yeah I mean we you know we obviously have a fairly good sense of uh you know what customers uh you know need from quarter to quarter and in a couple of instances customers uh ordered more than we think they were digesting uh and so you know it was really you know just the analytics that gave us insight into they're doing that for a reason and we know tariffs are a big um you know subject uh of a lot of our customers uh it was in the region you might expect in the Asian region that we saw this uh you know I it's hard for me to extrapolate this Beyond this quarter um you know A lot's not known yet around what might be the plans on tariffs I just thought it was a little bit of hedging going on by customers that you know pulled Revenue into the fourth quarter and away from the first quarter thank you Joe Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly and our next question comes in line of Timothy urry from UBS your question please thanks a lot um Dave I also wanted to ask about gross margin um I think the message you were saying is that it's kind of 60% um incremental and that was kind of off of the 395 that you guided for uh you know Q four but obviously you came in you had these one-timers and now we're down in March so can you just sort of like level set us for kind of how to think of the incrementals from here incrementals from q1 in other words into Q2 three and four is that what you're saying yeah just yeah just kind of like is it off a 39 yeah yeah the the rule of thumb has generally been 60% in this period of what what I call catchup obviously we think we can do better fall through as we get more stabilized um the one dynamic in 25 is this uh you know kind of margin pressure around product like lunar Lake that that probably you know pulls the range down to probably something more like in the 40 to 60% fall through is probably the right way to think about it uh just for for that Dynamic now we get into 26 and you start to see you know a lot more 18a volume through Panther Lake you know I think we're in the 60% plus range at that level Tim do you have a follow on question I do um yeah Dave also so um you took the capex to the low end but there's a billion two outflow that's in the financing section of the cash flow statement what what what is that I guess I'm trying to figure out just on an Apples to Apples basis is like capex really coming down this year and is that line item in the financing section is that going to keep getting bigger this year thanks yeah no the fin the you know the let's see let me go back in the capex um if you look at capex for to for 25 the 20 the 20 20 billion dollar forecast what's driving that lower is really a function of you better utilizing assets under construction so you know our philosophy had been to invest kind of ahead of uh what was required and we built up a pretty significant balance in assets under construction I mean to the tune of greater than \\$50 billion so we actually have a lot of capital on the balance sheet that really hasn't been deployed and so what we pushed the teams to do in an effort to drive better you know Roa and return on invested capital is to have them digest as much as that as possible and limit the amount of purchases uh that we that we make externally and that all that's going to allow us to get down to the to the2 billion range I would be we're not doing any funky financing around this but I would uh be you know in the spirit of transparency say that you know capex is two things right it's what what you place in terms of orders on equipment and it's when you give them the cash and so for sure we are working the payment terms of suppliers uh to improve our uh you know to improve our cap backs lower our cap backs that that is pushing uh you know spend out even as we're getting the Assets in but quite honestly by the time we've actually deployed it and it's depreciating we've actually in all cases I think spent the money um because it it goes onto assets under construction it probably hangs in there for like nine months before it's ever deployed thank you Tim Jonathan can we have the next question certainly our next question comes from the line of V area from Bank of America Securities your question please uh thanks for taking my question uh first uh kind of related questions are on uh the data center server on CPU Market um M I'm curious when you look at um you know Intel versus your x86 competitor do you think their share gains are because of better design or access to better you know manufacturing um and so what can be fixed and you know what will take uh time to fix so if you were to Outsource more right to external Foundry does does that help you regain a share and I imagine that applies more more to Cloud uh and then on the Enterprise side have you seen any share shifts uh at all uh over the last few years thanks VC um well as we look at Data Center and the competitiveness um as I said or stated earlier um you know Granite Rapids did a good job of making a good first step in closing the Gap versus competition but we still have a gap and so we've got to be laser focused next on delivering Diamond Rapids and the feedback for both of those products early is very is very positive when it comes to external manufacturing I've been pretty transparent about this and the way um I think about it in My Philosophy you know the way I look at it is you have to have the right product the right process and you have to deliver that within the right Market window if you look at Intel as overall today we do about 30% of our manufacturing externally across a variety of Partners that's probably the high for where we are today but it will never be 0% um what I can tell you is 18a is going well they earned my business obviously both for Panther Lake and for Clear waterer Forest but as I think about being more competitive in data center moving forward and I look at Future designs I will ask myself that question every time as we look at the road mapap so I think it would not be unfathomable that I would put a data center product outside if that meant that I hit the right product the right Market window as well as the right performance for my customers do you have a followup question yes thank you John so maybe one for Dave on this non-controlling interest I think Dave you said 5 to 700 million uh for this year so a little bit lower than um you know than I think the 700 you had before but then it starts to grow to 1.2 or 1.4 billion is this always going to you know keep on increasing um right like what is the right way for us to model it because the less you Outsource I I guess the more you insource the more you give to int Foundry the more reversals um right you have to do on this NCI part I I would imagine so is there a reasonable way to model how much of a headwind this is to your reported EPS yeah it's a good question I mean let just to break it all out it's more than just the Skips Skip one and two are obviously in there but but also uh mobilize shows up in non-controlling interest and as we sell down uh stakes in companies like mobile Altera it actually exacerbates that NCI so Altera doesn't have any NCI but as soon as we sell a stake it is going to have NCI so there are a number of things that go into it which makes it a little bit difficult to forecast because you have to kind of know what you have to know two things with certainty one exactly what share of every asset you have and to you know what your production is going to look like in the Fabs that you have um have these skips um so what we felt comfortable was was guiding uh guiding 25 and and giving you an indication for 26 it's likely to go up in 27 uh but I think it's probably too soon to actually identify what the exact number will look look like thanks for that Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly our next question comes from the line Ben rtis from melus your question please hey guys uh thanks lot for the question uh Dave and MJ I wanted to you know I know in your prepared remarks you said you look forward to working with the Trump Administration um I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about your initial talks with them uh have they reached out and who who's like leading the discussions from your side and you know any any color on what you're what you're exactly talking about and what they're particularly interested in I mean Howard lutnick obviously he sounds like this is very near and dear to him uh during his confirmation hearings and um would love to just kind of get a little bit more color on where you what you have done so far and where you think it's going um and then I'll have a followup thanks so much guys yeah okay thanks Ben uh maybe I'll take that as the co-ceo how's that um the uh you know we have good engagement with them we've we've really been engaged since the election uh with the team uh you know at various levels obviously uh at the CEO level uh but also we have a strong government Affairs team that engages with them every day uh I feel really good about their outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the US uh I think this is a very positive sign obviously for us quite honestly we never left the US so we're in a kind of the pole position in that regard uh and I think they understand the value of doing R&D in the US uh for advanced semiconductor manufacturing which also is positive um you know they want to see more jobs coming back to the US uh we pay high wage high-tech jobs uh so that's obviously positive for them but more importantly you know this is about security both in terms of just the supply chain but also in you know kind of secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense uh which you know we're obviously in a in a position to do for them um you know I imagine that you know as we progress uh we'll be more engaged with them uh to make this a reality uh and uh both Michelle and I will be meeting um fairly regularly with with the Trump Administration uh officials to go make their their goals a reality for the US Ben you said you had a followup yeah thanks um I want to double click on a prior question on Gross margins and and ask it a a little bit more in caveman terms rather than incrementals um you know you talked about one Q being the bottom um I'm trying to figure out you know how high you know it goes sequentially as we go throughout the year giving sounds like you're going to be a lot more price aggressive in server CPUs and client CPUs from what I heard so you know in addition to you know I'm trying to balance that with the thought of of Outsourcing more to tsmc for the year Etc so if that's the low point I guess what I'm trying to say can you be more prescriptive in light of that pricing comment I made and and if it's right you know then just give us a little more color on where we go from the one Q that'd be great thanks yeah yeah I mean you intend to be competitive uh in the product space and also you know as I mentioned the cost structure is uh you know under some pressure in particular because of lunar Lake uh so that that absolutely will impact the gross margins on products uh there won't be a lot of lift uh in that business unit uh through the year and it's really not until Panther Lake comes that they I think start to see some better cost structure and you know have a have a part that's very competitive that I think allows us to uh you know perhaps even relax some of that um that pressure in a competitive market that said The Foundry business will see improvements um you know over the course of the year uh more Wafers will will be coming back uh with Panther Lake it becomes even better uh in the following year uh we are improving the cost structure of The Foundry business as part of our overall spending reduction plan so that will also help and then just keep in mind you know these these Wafers that uh we're producing at Intel 3 and ATA uh have much better cost structure uh and margin structure uh relative I should say Rel relative to the price structure uh than their predecessors and that will be beneficial on The Foundry side so in the caveman uh macro sense I think the best thing to do is probably take this like somewhere in the 40 to 60% fall through and that's probably the right rough order math uh to get you to where the margins will go in any quarter based on you know what you're projecting the revenue to be in that quarter thanks Ben Jonathan can we have the next question please certainly our next question comes from the line of Aaron rers from Fargo your question please yeah thanks for taking a question I want to build off of that that that last question a little bit you know during the prepared remarks you you had mentioned 1% in 2023 was euv uh wafer mix and that that progressed to north of 5% uh this year can c can you give us a a framework of how how you would define success uh looking through 2025 maybe exiting the year as far as euv wafer mix and remind us again what the what the the Delta is and terms of cost structure the the margin dynamics of an EU euv wafer yeah well I'll say um on the second part maybe I'll I'll answer that one first I would say the price on those Wafers goes up at 3x the cost of those of those W or sorry maybe said it the Blended ASP and cost goes up three uh 3x as you go to 18a versus the the cost so it's a pretty dramatic Improvement in Gross margins uh as you move into 18a versus you know pre waivers um you know I I probably be tough for me to Hazard a guess on exactly how we'll exit the year in terms of our percentage of euv it's definitely going to go up um you know granted is on Intel 3 uh Panther Lake is is on uh metor lake is on Intel 3 or four called 4 three weight node uh Panther Lake is on 18a this year so we'll we'll see a pretty meaningful jump in the percentage of Wafers that will be euv uh as we exit 25 y do you have a followup question I I do and it's probably a dumb question but I'm just going to ask it because I'm just a little confused that you know the skip impact this this five to 700 million going to 1.2 billion just just remind us again so we're all clear that when you report EPS on a on a on a non-gaap basis that's that's in that EPS number just so we I'm modeling it correctly I'm sure my my peers are already but I I want to make sure I've got that all clear in my head yeah I just want to make be clear it's not just skip I mean that includes the mobile eye income uh and will include the Altera income to some extent but yeah all of that in the NCI we do take it against our non-gaap uh number to to get our fully deluded non-gaap PPS number Aaron thank you Jonathan we have time for one more question certainly and our final question for today comes from the line of sery paseri from Raymond James your question please thank you thanks for squeezing me in um Dave on the um Foundry break even I guess Target for 2027 maybe can you um talk about what are the assumptions behind that I mean do you think you can get there with u you know mostly internal Wafers or do you need external customers as well if so you know what sort of Revenue do we need from external customers to I guess achieve that break even yeah so you know we're still aiming to get uh to break even in 27 as you pointed out it's really on the back of internal Wafers or you know Wafers from Intel products I should say um and uh you know it's it's you know obviously a lot based on uh euv Wafers which carry a better margin and as that mix improves that significantly improves uh the margins but more importantly I I think you know the original premise by creating this different p&l structure was to drive the boundary business really at that point was just a function manufacturing to be more focused on efficiency to squeeze out more from the existing footprint to be more sensitive to Capital and ultimately just think about roic and everything they do and I think that has worked actually I mean I hear it all the time it's amazing the transformation we've seen in staff meetings and Michelle and I uh that attend that you know how they're they're they completely pivoted to how to make money uh in that business and so I think it's working uh I think we'll see significantly more efficiency as we go into uh you know work through 25 and into 26 so I feel good about our ability to get to break even obviously we we want to have uh external customers and so you know we have a some some very small amount that we've assumed for 27 uh but if 18a looks like it's it's something that hunts based on feedback from customers and I feel like we will probably outperform in that regard uh in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers so you know those are all the factors that I think will drive uh 27 to profitability and ultimately obviously want to get to or PR the break even and ultimately want to get the business to a to a profitable level that's you know consistent with what The Foundry industry gets Trina do you have a quick follow one yeah quick one so on the 18a Panther Lake U I think in the past I think Dave the comment was that you know you you expect to bring roughly 70% of the die inhouse is that still the plan and then is that pretty set in stone that you know you're bringing it back for sure or do you have any flexibility uh whether to bring back more of the D or less of the D you know if you need to so just trying to understand you know yeah I'm gonna let Michelle answer that because it really is her decision on how she builds her products yeah so we did move Panther Lake um inside it's an 18a design one but as I stated before you know we look at each generation of product based on what's the right product what's the right process what's the right Market window and what allows our customers to win so for Panther Lake that was 18a and as I said we're very happy with where we are from a performance and yield perspective at this point in the process so that will stay on 188 then as you look forward to you know our next Generation product for client after that Nova Lake we'll actually have die both inside and outside for that process so you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside again it's about optimizing to what allows us to win in the market what allows us to win with our customers and optimizing the overall product portfolio because at the end of the day if our customers are successful we win that drives more you know wafers in Intel Foundry and that allows us to win but I'll continue to have a balance and as I said we'll be doing the same look across our data center portfolio as well all right thanks Michelle so with that let me wrap up by saying thank you uh as always for joining the call uh MJ and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress and the actions we've taken Q4 was a good step forward obviously but we have have a lot of hard work ahead of us and we're looking forward to updating you as we go along we hope to see many of you in person at the investors conferences will be attending in q1 and I'd also like to highlight that the Intel boundary team will be hosting their second annual Direct Connect user event on April 29th in San Jose and we hope many of you will join that in person so thank you and good night thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference this does conclude the program you may now disconnect good day\", \"## Title\\n\\nIntel Corp (INTC) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Highlights - Yahoo Finance\\n\\n##

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with INTC.\\n\\n\\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\\nPositive Points\\n\\n\\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered revenue, gross margin, and EPS above guidance for Q4 2024.\\n\\n\\nThe company achieved key grant-related milestones, supporting solid upside to gross margins.\\n\\n\\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) remains a market leader in AI PC CPUs, with plans to ship over 100 million systems by the end of 2025.\\n\\n\\nThe launch of Panther Lake on Intel 18A is on track for the second half of 2025, showcasing progress in performance and yield.\\n\\n\\nIntel Foundry has made good progress with Intel 18A, showing competitive offerings and a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers.\\n\\n\\nNegative Points\\n\\n\\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) faces increased competition in the AI PC category, impacting market dynamics.\\n\\n\\nThe company is not yet participating meaningfully in the cloud-based AI data center market.\\n\\n\\nIntel Foundry reported a significant operating loss of over \\$13 billion in 2024, with negative gross margins.\\n\\n\\nQ1 2025 guidance indicates a sequential revenue decline of 11% to 18%, reflecting macro uncertainty and seasonality.\\n\\n\\nIntel Products' gross margins are expected to be under pressure throughout 2025 due to product mix and cost structure.\\n\\n\\nQ & A Highlights\\nQ: Can you talk about how much you think Granite Rapids is closing the gap in the DCAI side of things and any updates on Clearwater Forest? A: Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Interim Co-CEO, explained that Granite Rapids is a good first step in closing the gap with competitors, and customers are excited about it. Clearwater Forest is seen as a niche market product, expected to come to market in the first half of 2026. The focus is on consistent execution over the next 1 to 2 years to improve competitiveness.\\nStory Continues\\nQ: Can you walk us through the gross margin sequentially in the first quarter and the headwinds and tailwinds for 2025? A: David Zinsner, Interim Co-CEO and CFO, noted that the revenue decline is the biggest contributor to lower gross margins in Q1. Intel Products' margins will be under pressure due to higher costs, particularly with Lunar Lake. Improvements are expected later in the year with Panther Lake and increased EUV wafer mix in Intel Foundry.\\nQ: Why are all three product segments down equally in the next quarter? A: David Zinsner explained that macro uncertainty and typical seasonality are affecting all markets, leading to a cautious outlook across all segments.\\nQ: How has your strategy evolved for Intel Foundry Services (IFS) under new co-leadership? A: David Zinsner emphasized a more conservative approach, focusing on not spending ahead of success and being cautious with capital deployment. The goal remains to build a world-class foundry, aligning with US government interests.\\nQ: What was behind the tempering of expectations for Falcon Shores, and what does it take to get competitive in that space? A: Michelle Johnston Holthaus stated that the decision was based on competitive and execution perspectives. The focus is on delivering a complete rack-scale solution with Jaguar Shores, leveraging learnings from Gaudi, and addressing customer needs for a full-scale solution.\\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\\nView Comments\\nTerms and Privacy Policy\\nPrivacy Dashboard\\nMore Info\\n\\nRecommended Stories\\n\\nCopyright © 2025 Yahoo.

With a market cap of \\$88.7 billion, Intel drives technological advancements by delivering cutting-edge processors and solutions that power data centers, personal computing, and artificial intelligence. The company is set to release its Q4 earnings on Thursday, Jan. 23.\\nAhead of the event, analysts expect Intel to report a loss of \\$0.04 per share, down 110.5% from \\$0.38 in the year-ago quarter. The company missed the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while beating on another occasion.\\nIts adjusted loss of \\$0.63 per share for the last quarter missed the consensus estimate by 215%. Intel’s Q3 miss was driven by a \\$3.1 billion impairment charge, weaker PC and server demand, and ongoing operational challenges.\\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect Intel to report a loss per share of \\$0.87, down 329% from a profit of \\$0.38 per share in fiscal 2023. However, in fiscal 2025, EPS is expected to rebound, growing by 124.1% year-over-year to \\$0.21.\\n\\nwww.barchart.com\\nIntel's shares have declined 56.3% over the past 52 weeks, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 Index's (\\$SPX) 26.3% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLK) 27.1% gain during the same period.\\n\\nwww.barchart.com\\nINTC stock dropped over 5% on Dec. 18, contributing to a broader sell-off in chip stocks that erased early market gains. Despite ongoing challenges, INTC jumped 7.8% following its Q3 earnings results on Oct. 31. The company reported revenue of \\$13.28 billion, beating analyst expectations by 1.8%, though sales fell 6.2% year over year.\\nFor Q4 2024, Intel projects revenue of \\$13.8 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts. However, steep declines in key metrics, such as a 15% gross margin and negative free cash flow of \\$2.7 billion, continue to raise concerns about its profitability and operations.\\nWall Street maintains a cautious stance on Intel, with a consensus rating of \\\"Hold.\\\" Among the 37 analysts covering the stock, one rates it a \\\"Strong Buy,\\\" 30 recommend \\\"Hold,\\\" one suggests a \\\"Moderate Sell,\\\" and five rate it as a \\\"Strong Sell.\\\"\\nThe average price target of \\$26.10 indicates a potential upside of 26.9% from current levels.\\nOn the date of publication, Rashmi Kumari did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Zinsner explained that the decline is due to a combination of macro uncertainty and typical seasonality across all markets. He added that the company is cautious about the macro environment and that seasonality affects all markets.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the persistence of the decline in client and data center segments through the year and the impact of increased competition on pricing.\\n\\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus explained that the company faces increased competition from new market entrants, particularly in the CCG market, and that the margins on the Lunar Lake product are more pressured due to the cost of the product. However, the company is committed to stemming the market segment share decline in client and data center and will be aggressive in winning every socket.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the incremental growth rate from Q4 to Q2, Q3, and Q4.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner explained that the incremental growth rate from Q4 to Q2, Q3, and Q4 is not clear and that the company is still working on it.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the CapEx budget for 2025 and whether it is coming down this year.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner explained that the CapEx budget for 2025 is \\$20 billion, which is lower than the previous budget due to better utilization of assets under construction. The company has a significant balance in assets under construction, which has not been fully deployed, and the team is working to digest as much as possible and limit external purchases to improve ROA and return on invested capital. The company is also working on payment terms with suppliers to improve CapEx and lower costs.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about Intel's approach to outsourcing manufacturing and the impact of external foundries on regaining share, specifically in the cloud and enterprise segments.\\n\\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel's Chief Financial Officer, explained that the company's approach to outsourcing manufacturing is to ensure that it has the right product, process, and market window, and that it will never be completely outsourced. She also mentioned that the company's current outsourcing rate is around 30% and that it may consider outsourcing data center products in the future if it means hitting the right product, market window, and performance for customers.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about modeling the impact of NCI (non-controlling interest) on reported EPS, specifically the impact of selling stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner, Intel's Chief Financial Officer, explained that NCI is affected by more than just SCIPs (stock compensation plans). He mentioned that Mobileye shows up in non-controlling interest, and as Intel sells stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera, it exacerbates the NCI. He also mentioned that it's difficult to forecast the impact of NCI on reported EPS due to the complexity of the situation, and that it's too soon to identify an exact number.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the progress of the discussions with the government officials regarding the semiconductor manufacturing in the US.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner, co-CEO of Intel, stated that they have good engagement with the government officials, including the CEO level, and have a strong government affairs team that engages with them every day. He also mentioned that the government officials are interested in bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the US and that they understand the value of doing R&D in the US. Additionally, they want to see more jobs coming back to the US and are interested in secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the pricing comment and the impact on gross margins on products.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner explained that the cost structure is under some pressure due to Lunar Lake, which will impact the gross margins on products. However, he mentioned that the Foundry business will see improvements over the course of the year, and more wafers will be coming back with Panther Lake, which will have a better cost structure and margin structure relative to the price structure. He suggested that a rough order of math to get to where the margins will go in any quarter based on the projected revenue would be somewhere in the range of 40% to 60%.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the assumptions behind Intel's plan to achieve profitability in 2027, specifically whether it can be achieved with internal wafers or if external customers are also needed.\\n\\nDavid A. Zinsner, CEO of Intel, explained that the company is aiming to achieve profitability in 2027 based on internal wafers, with a focus on EUV wafers that carry a better margin. He noted that the original premise of creating a different P&L structure was to drive the foundry business towards efficiency and to focus on ROIC. He also mentioned that the company has seen a transformation in staff meetings, with a focus on how to make money in the business, and that they will see significantly more efficiency as they work through 2025 and into 2026. He acknowledged that the company wants to have external customers, but that they have assumed a small amount for 2027, and that they will probably outperform in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers. He concluded by stating that the company wants to achieve profitability and ultimately wants to get the business to a profitable level that's consistent with what the foundry industry gets.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyst asked about the plan to bring back the die inside the chip for the Panther Lake product and whether it's set in stone or if the company has flexibility to bring back more or less of the die.\\n\\nMichelle Johnston Holthaus, EVP and GM of the Data Platforms Group, explained that the company moved Panther Lake inside of 18A design win, but that it was based on what's the right product, process, market window, and what allows the company's customers to win. She stated that they are very happy with the performance and yield of Panther Lake at this point in the process, and that it will stay on 18A. For the next-generation product, Nova Lake, the company will have compute tiles inside and outside, allowing them to optimize their product portfolio and win in the market. She noted that they will continue to have a balance between internal and external customers, and that they will be doing the same look across their data center portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n\\nSourceQ4 2024 Earnings Call\\nRelated Companies:\\n ASMLASML Holding NV AMDAdvanced Micro Devices Inc AMATApplied Materials Inc AVGOBroadcom Inc NVDANVIDIA Corp NXPINXP Semiconductors N.V.

The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of Intel's internal foundry operating model, Intel announced in the third quarter of 2024 its intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. The company also previously announced its intent to operate Altera® as a standalone business. Altera was previously included in DCAI's segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \\\"all other.\\\" As a result of these changes, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives information and manages and monitors its operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to Intel’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.\\nBusiness Unit Revenue and Trends Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023 2024 vs. 2023Intel Products:          Client Computing Group (CCG) \\$8.0 billion down9% \\$30.3 billion up4%Data Center and AI (DCAI) \\$3.4 billion down3% \\$12.8 billion up1%Network and Edge (NEX) \\$1.6 billion up10% \\$5.8 billion up1%Total Intel Products revenue \\$13.0 billion down6% \\$48.9 billion up3%Intel Foundry \\$4.5 billion down13% \\$17.5 billion down7%All other \\$1.0 billion down20% \\$3.8 billion down32%Intersegment eliminations \\$(4.3) billion    \\$(17.2) billion   Total net revenue \\$14.3 billion down7% \\$53.1 billion down2%\\nIntel Products Highlights\\n\\n\\nCCG: Intel continues to lead the AI PC category.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.\\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related effects to income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate. For 2024 and 2023, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 13%. For 2025, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 12%. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests are calculated by adjusting for the minority stockholder portion of non-GAAP adjustments we make for relevant acquisition-related costs, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and income tax effects, as applicable to each majority-owned subsidiary.\\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\\nNon-GAAPadjustment ormeasureDefinitionUsefulness to management and investorsAcquisition-related adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.Share-based compensationShare-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans.We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.Restructuring and other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. 2024 mainly includes charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, primarily composed of cash-based employee severance and benefit arrangements, and cash and non-cash charges related to real estate exits and consolidations, as well as non-cash construction-in-progress asset impairments resulting from business exit activities. Other charges include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, and other costs associated with certain non-core activities. 2024 includes non-cash charges resulting from the impairment of goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets. 2023 includes a benefit as a result of developments in the VLSI litigation and two legal related fees, which we do not expect to recur, relating to an annulled EC-imposed fine and a termination fee relating to Tower. 2023 also includes costs associated with a formal restructuring plan approved in 2022 and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.(Gains) losses on equity investments, net(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, and the gains (losses) from the sale of equity investments and other.We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures to provide comparability between periods. The exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business.(Gains) losses from divestiture(Gains) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND memory business in 2021, a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Interest received related to an annulled European Commission (EC) fineInterest received in 2024 related to an annulled EC-imposed fine that was paid in 2009 and refunded to us in 2022.We exclude this non-operating and non-recurring interest income for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past results and provides a useful evaluation of our current performance.Deferred tax assets valuation allowancesA non-cash charge recorded to provision for (benefit from) income taxes related to a discreet valuation allowance recorded against our US deferred tax assets.We excluded a discrete non-cash charge in 2024 related to a valuation allowance established against our US deferred tax assets due to a historical cumulative loss for GAAP purposes. We excluded the discreet valuation allowance when calculating certain non-GAAP measures, as there is no such historical cumulative loss on a non-GAAP basis. Because of the size of the charge, the adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to our past operating results.Adjusted free cash flowWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and net partner contributions, and (2) payments on finance leases.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business.Net capital spendingWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of net capital spending, which is additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and net partner contributions.We believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about our capital investment activities and capital offsets, and allows for greater transparency with respect to a key metric used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance.\\nIntel Corporation\\nSupplemental Reconciliations of GAAP Actuals to Non-GAAP Actuals\\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Again as a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, corporate vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our interim co-CEOs, Michelle Johnston Holthaus and Dave Zinsner.\\nAs you know, Michelle is also CEO of Intel products, and Dave continues to serve as Intel's CFO. In a few moments, Michelle will open up with some summary comments before providing more detail on Intel products. Dave will then discuss Intel foundry and the overall financials, including our Q1 guidance. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it.\\nAnd as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures.\\nWith that, let me turn things over to Michelle.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome. It's been roughly two months since Dave and I stepped into our roles as interim co-CEOs. From day one, we have been working closely together alongside the board to drive better execution of our strategy. There are no quick fixes.\\nAnd we are committed to improving our performance and rebuilding our credibility through persistent hard work that delivers tangible results. As part of this, we are driving more focused investments across the business. We cannot be all things to all people, and we are prioritizing areas where we can drive differentiated value. We are also continuing to simplify our business and become a leaner, more efficient company.\\nAnd most of all, we are doing a better job of listening to our customers to ensure we meet their needs. Q4 was a step in the right direction. We delivered revenue, gross margin, and EPS above our guide. Intel products executed to drive revenue in the quarter, even as PC inventory continue to normalize.\\nAnd Intel foundry drove incremental operating efficiencies while achieving key grant-related milestones, which supported solid upside to gross margins. As co-CEOs, you can expect us to be very straightforward and direct. We only make commitments we are confident we can deliver. We firmly believe that what we say is not nearly as important as what we do.\\nAnd everything we do must be in service of our customers. Innovating to solve their most pressing challenges is the surest path to creating shareholder value. This is the mindset I have brought to my position as the CEO of Intel products. This is a great business with great people, partners, and IP to design world-class products from edge to cloud.\\nI take nothing for granted. But I firmly believe that the core x86 architecture and the ecosystem we have built and invested in over the decades, create a solid foundation for success. Our customers share this view. But they need us to improve our execution and hit our commitments.\\nI am setting clear priorities and directions in each business to drive better outcomes. I think about Intel products in three buckets. First, client edge; second, traditional data center; and third, the AI data center. Let me spend a few moments on each.\\nIn client, Intel CPUs power roughly seven out of every 10 PCs. This is a strong position that gives us advantages in the market. That said, the market is becoming more competitive, especially as we see new entrants trying to participate in the AI PC category. Personally, I thrive on competition.\\nIt drives a healthy paranoia across everything we do, and we're using it as motivation to up our game even more. The success of Core Ultra across, Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake has established Intel as the market leader in AI PC CPUs, and we remain on track to ship more than 100 million cumulative systems by the end of 2025. We are innovating at scale unlike any of our competitors. This was on display earlier this month at CES where we launched the enterprise versions of our AI CPUs with compelling new features to Intel vPro.\\nThis is a testament to the strong ecosystem we have built with IT departments, around manageability, security, trust and brand. And we expect these investments to position us well as corporations begin their migration to Windows 11. Alongside our investments in enterprise, our ecosystem reach also positions us well in AI PC consumer markets. We are working with more than 200 ISVs across more than 400 features to optimize their software on our silicon.\\nI'm excited about the new applications I'm seeing in the pipeline that will begin to proliferate over the coming months. Our goal is to innovate, partner and fortify our position as the preferred CPU of choice. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we will strengthen our client road map with the launch of Panther Lake, our lead product on Intel 18A in the second half of 2025. As the first volume customer of Intel 18A, I see the progress that Intel foundry is making on performance and yields, and I look forward to being in production in the second half as we demonstrate the benefits of our world-class design and process technology capabilities.\\n2026 is even more exciting from a client perspective as Panther Lake achieved meaningful volumes, and we introduced our next-generation client family code named Nova Lake. Both will provide strong performance across the entire PC stack with significantly better costs and margins for us, enhancing our competitive position and reinforcing our value proposition to our partners and customers. Let me now turn to our traditional data center business. The team has made good progress toward strengthening our offerings and driving better, more predictable execution.\\nThis year is all about improving Xeon's competitive position as we fight harder to close the gap to competition. The ramp of Granite Rapids has been a good first step. We are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year. All of this provides a strong foundation on which to build as we execute.\\nThe world's data center workloads still primarily run on Intel silicon, and we have a strong ecosystem, especially within enterprise. We are going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025. One of the ways we'll do this is by reengaging the x86 ecosystem. We have seen a positive response from the x86 ecosystem advisory group we formed last fall, and we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for building both semi-custom and custom products.\\nThis is a big area of opportunity for the business, and we look forward to talking more about this as we have news to share. Turning to the AI data center. I will start by saying that this is an attractive market for us over time, but I am not happy with where we are today. On the one hand, we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers.\\nAnd we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU-based inference on-prem and at the edge as AI-infused applications proliferate. On the other hand, we're not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way. We have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi and we are applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our road map and concentrate our resources.\\nMany of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month. Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center. More broadly, as I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably, to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute.\\nAI is not a market in the traditional sense. It's an enabling application that needs to span across the compute continuum from data center to the edge. As such, a one-size-fit-all approach will not work, and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the continuum. Before I turn the call over to Dave, let me close by speaking as Intel foundry's largest wafer customer.\\nI have a pretty simple approach. When we are able to combine world-class products with world-class process technology, we win. As CEO of Intel products, I will always make process technology decisions based on what is best for my customers. And Intel foundry will need to earn my business every day, just as I need to earn the business of my customers.\\nHaving said that, I'm confident in Intel foundry's team ability to support my current and future product road map. And I'm excited to do more business with them as their process technology continues to advance. A stronger Intel product, combined with a more competitive Intel foundry is a recipe for success for Intel overall. Dave, over to you.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Michelle. Let me add my welcome. I'm going to address three topics today: update on Intel foundry; second, Q4 and full year financials; and third, our Q1 guidance. Starting with Intel foundry.\\nI've had an opportunity to meet with a number of our partners and potential customers for Intel foundry over the last couple of months. I come away from those meetings encouraged by the opportunity we have in front of us, and I've received clear feedback on what our customers need from us to succeed. This starts with our execution on Intel 18A. This has been an area of good progress.\\nLike any new process, there have been puts and takes along the way, but overall, we're confident that we are delivering a competitive process. We're excited by the launch of Panther Lake this year and the internal ramp of Intel 18A in the second half that will support increased volumes and improved profitability in 2026. From the perspective of external customers, Intel 18A is a very competitive offering that gives each of them a reason to engage with us. However, foundry wins are about more than just technology.\\nTrust is also a significant factor. Customers must believe you can execute consistently and be willing to invest in IP to port a design to a new foundry. That's why past transitions in the industry have generally started with customers giving new foundry partners smaller volumes then gradually increasing as trust grows. We've made good progress, but to accelerate this, I'm asking the team to redouble their efforts.\\nSupporting IP availability and best-known foundry methods. I'm particularly pleased by the willingness of our suppliers and partners to engage with us augmenting our expertise and hard work with theirs. Job number one is earning the customer's trust. The Intel 18A design wins to date provide good validation of the strategy, and we continue to have a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers.\\nBut we won't win every deal out of the gates. We'll be selective and focused on areas where we are confident that we can be a meaningful contributor to the success of our customer and we look forward to updating you as RFQs become wins. In addition, we continue to have good momentum in advanced packaging and in our collaboration with Tower Semiconductor and UMC. All three are critical to utilize our assets longer for higher rates of return.\\nThis is a good segue into my other key areas of focus for Intel foundry, improving our financials and making sure that we're deploying our capital appropriately. At roughly \\$18 billion in revenue, Intel foundry today is larger than all but one external foundry. That's clearly not reflected on our P&L with negative gross margins and a greater than \\$13 billion operating loss in 2024. We're going to systematically attack our costs and remain highly focused on our goal of delivering breakeven operating income for Intel foundry by the end of 2027, and we expect to demonstrate improvements this year.\\nThe financial benefits of shifting our wafer volume from Intel 7 to Intel 18A along with learning to run our fabs more efficiently and our process nodes longer will be important drivers of improving our financials. Beyond 2027, we need to drive to cash flow from operations that supports our capital spending needs and ultimately generate a great return on your capital. I remain very optimistic on our opportunity at Intel foundry. The pervasive growth of AI is driving accelerating and unprecedented demand for silicon, and there continues to be an unmet need for greater choice and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry today.\\nTSMC is a valued supplier to Intel products, an important partner to IMS, and they've established a very high standard for what it takes to be a world-class foundry. But the market overall needs multiple players. And as we execute, Intel foundry has a very important role to play globally and especially here in the U.S., where we continue to invest in leading-edge R&D and manufacturing capacity. We're also pleased to sign with the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce a definitive agreement awarding us up to \\$7.86 billion in grants. As you know, these grants are milestone-based and we have already received \\$1.1 billion in Q4 and have received an additional \\$1.1 billion in January of Q1. In addition, we continue to make good progress building out our Secure Enclave in partnership with the Department of Defense. We look forward to continued engagement with the Trump administration as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen U.S.\\ntechnology and manufacturing leadership. Finally, as you will recall, we announced our intention to establish an independent subsidiary structure for Intel foundry to provide clear governance and operational separation. This structure also enables us to seek additional funding options from both strategic and financial partners, which we are now actively beginning to explore. Let me now turn to our consolidated financial results and Q1 guidance was \\$14.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of the range we provided in October as a result of solid growth in CCG, equipment sales at IMS and the edge business of NEX Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 42.1%, 260 basis points ahead of guidance on higher revenue, better costs and the receipt of our first chips grant, offset partially by inventory reserves related to Gaudi.\\nWe delivered fourth quarter earnings per share of \\$0.13 versus our guidance of \\$0.12. Higher revenue, stronger gross margin, and improved operating leverage was offset by lower interest and other income, which includes an accrual related to our second SCIP agreement of roughly \\$750 million, reflecting an adjustment in our planned capacity ramp in Ireland. In Q2, we began the process of resizing our expense structure to support more modest long-term growth, including adjusting our capacity plans to more conservative levels, driving impairments in Q3 and this accrual in Q4. Q4 operating cash flow was positive \\$3.2 billion, down approximately \\$900 million sequentially due to the cash outlays associated with our Q3 restructuring charges.\\nWe had gross capex of \\$6.3 billion with offsets of \\$1.6 billion in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative \\$1.5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we also received a portion of the chips grants this quarter. For the full year, revenue was \\$53.1 billion, down 2.1% year over year. Modest year-over-year growth in Intel products was more than offset by lower revenue at Mobileye and Altera, as well as the forecasted decline in foundry services due to the end of life on traditional packaging revenue.\\nFull year gross margin was 36% and down 760 basis points due to Q3 impairments, lower revenue and inventory impacts. Full year EPS was minus \\$0.13 and down \\$1.18 on lower revenue, lower gross margin and higher period charges. We generated \\$8.3 billion in cash from operations, made \\$24 billion of gross capital investments and generated capital offsets of approximately \\$13.4 billion from Skip partner contributions and government grants and incentives. As a result, adjusted free cash flow was minus \\$2.2 billion, and we ended the year with \\$22.1 billion of cash and short-term investments.\\nMoving to segment results for Q4. Intel products revenue was \\$13 billion, up 7% sequentially. CCG revenue was up 9% quarter over quarter as the rate at which our customers digested inventory slowed meaningfully from Q3. While difficult to quantify, we suspect a portion of Q4 revenue upside was due to customers' hedging against potential tariffs.\\nDCI revenue was up slightly sequentially of a better-than-expected Q3 as demand for traditional servers remain stable. Revenue per NEX was up 7.5% sequentially and is now up more than 20% from Q2 lows as customers are returning to more normal buying patterns, especially in our edge business. Operating profit for Intel products was \\$3.6 billion, 28% of revenue and up \\$300 million quarter over quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Intel foundry delivered revenue of \\$4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially on increased EUV wafer mix and higher equipment sales by IMS.\\nEUV wafer revenue grew from 1% of total revenue in 2023 to greater than 5% in 2024. Intel foundry operating loss in Q4 of \\$2.3 billion improved meaningfully sequentially as Q3 was impacted by \\$3.1 billion of impairments. Excluding impairments, operating loss would have been roughly flat quarter on quarter. Turning to All other.\\nMobileye reported revenue of \\$490 million, up 1% sequentially, with operating profit of \\$103 million and earlier today guided for full year 2025 increases to both revenue and operating income. Altera delivered revenue of \\$429 million, up 4% sequentially. Operating margin was 21% versus 2% in Q3 on better gross margins and operating leverage. For Q1, we expect Altera revenue to be down sequentially, less than overall Intel consolidated.\\nWe continue to make good progress on the stake sale of Altera and see a path for an IPO in the coming years. Now turning to guidance. Q1 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, down high single to low double digits percentage sequentially on average. In addition, we see added pressure coming from macro uncertainty, especially around tariffs, balancing of PC inventory and increasing competition.\\nThese mitigating factors support a more tempered revenue outlook as we come into the new year. As a result, we're forecasting a revenue range of \\$11.7 billion to \\$12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down between 11% to 18% sequentially. Within Intel products, we expect revenue to decline across all three of our segments at roughly similar rates. We expect Intel foundry revenue roughly flat to down modestly quarter over quarter, helped by continued mix shift to EUV wafers, Intel 18A samples and advanced packaging.\\nAt the midpoint of \\$12.2 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 36%, with a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis. Let me take a few moments to provide some commentary that may be helpful for your full year 2025 modeling. At the consolidated level, we expect gross margin to improve from Q1. Intel products gross margin was 51% in 2024 and is expected to decline this year due to product mix in both CCG and DCAI.\\nIntel foundry gross margin will improve on EUV mix shift and growth in advanced packaging despite expected depreciation growth in 2025 of roughly 10%. We continue to target 2025 opex of \\$17.5 billion with further reductions in 2026. We expect noncontrolled income or NCI to net to roughly zero in Q1 and be in the range of \\$500 million to \\$700 million impact this year on a GAAP basis. NCI is expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 to a range of \\$1.2 billion to \\$1.4 billion on a GAAP basis and increase further in future years as we increase wafer outs at our fabs where we have agreements with SCIP partners.\\nWe anticipate that our 2025 gross capital investments will be approximately \\$20 billion at the low end of our previous guide of \\$20 billion to \\$23 billion reflecting further capacity adjustments to Ohio and Ireland, as well as better utilization of what we call our construction in progress. Specifically, we invested ahead of demand over the past few years, and these capital investments will enable us to meet expected demand at a lower level of spending as we drive to more efficiently deploy our capital. We expect 2025 net capex of \\$8 billion to \\$11 billion, with roughly half of the offsets expected to come from government incentives and tax credits and half from partner contributions. Delivering in 2025 remains a top priority for us on lower capex, increased cash from operations, and value unlocked across our noncore assets.\\nFinally, I will remind you that we will provide new segment reporting in conjunction with our Q1 earnings. We expect to make further changes to our segments, including moving the edge portion of NEX into CCG and our auto business from All Other into CCG. In addition, we expect to move the networking portion of NEX, which includes Xeon sales into DCAI and the IMS equipment business out of Intel foundry into All Other. I'll wrap up by saying that Q4 was a solid quarter to close out a challenging year.\\nWith that said, our profitability is below where it needs to be, and we must enhance our competitive position in the market. Michelle and I will continue taking actions to improve the operational and financial trajectory of the business. We'll remain focused on building a stronger Intel products business and becoming a more efficient Intel foundry. And by driving continued progress in these areas, we're confident in our ability to unlock value for our stakeholders.\\nBefore we open the line to questions, it's worth mentioning that the board remains intensely focused on the search for a permanent CEO. The search is progressing, but we have nothing new to report and won't be able to add additional information on this topic today. With that, I'll turn it over to John to start the Q&A.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\nOperator\\nCertainly, and our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\\nRoss Seymore -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one would be for MJ. You talked about no quick fixes, but a lot of things to improve the road map.\\nSpecifically, on the DCAI side of things. Can you talk about how much you think Granite is closing the gap? It sounds like Clearwater Forest is not mentioned nearly as much as far as a 2025 event neither from a launch or from a revenue perspective. So, if there's any updates on that? And then just overall, what it's going to take? And when do you think we will be able to externally see that gap close versus competitors?\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nSure. Thanks for the question, Ross. I look at it this way. So, when I talk about no quick fixes, I think it's going to be one to two years of consistent execution and continuing to see better products each year, really to bring our customers back to the table and be excited about Intel's road map.\\nGranite Rapids is a good first step in doing that. It does close the gap. Our customers are excited about it, and we are starting to see the competitiveness of that product materialize in volume. But I'm also very clear about where we stand.\\nAnd so, we've just got to see that continued throughout '26 when we get to Diamond Rapids, etc. So, you also asked me about Clearwater Forest. So, I really look at the data center market in kind of two buckets. We have our P-core products, which you know is Granite Rapids and then we have our E-core products, which equates to Clearwater Forest.\\nAnd what we've seen is that's more of a niche market, and we haven't seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected. But as we look at Clearwater Forest, we expect that to come to market in the first half of 2026. And 18A is doing just fine on a performance and yield for Granite Rapids, but it does have some complicated packaging expectations that move it to 2026. But we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well.\\nBut this is going to be a journey. It's not a destination.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nRoss, do you have a follow-up question?\\nRoss Seymore -- Analyst\\nYeah, switching over to Dave on the profitability side. Can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes on the gross margin sequentially in the first quarter? Obviously, revenues are down, but anything else? And then you mentioned that it would be the low point of the year gross margin in the first quarter. But what would be the headwinds and tailwinds as you think through 2025 as a whole on that metric? Thank you.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Thanks, Ross. OK. So, for the first quarter, the biggest obvious contributor to gross margins sequentially is the revenue decline.\\nAt the midpoint, we're declining a little over \\$2 billion. And so that obviously on a mostly fixed cost business, that does affect it. We also did have a couple of bluebirds in Q4. One was the revenue beat, and so that actually elevated the revenue a bit.\\nBut the other was when we signed the CHIPS agreement, we were able to take some of the grant and accrue it as kind of a benefit to cost of sales because it offset period expenses we had spent before. So, we weren't sure we were going to sign it in the fourth quarter, which is why I didn't guide that in the guidance from last quarter, but obviously, materializing that pushed the gross margins up for the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, I think what and we've kind of telegraphed this now for several quarters. Intel products gross margins are going to be under pressure this year.\\nSome of the parts have a higher cost, in particular, Lunar Lake has a higher cost, as you know, because it's got the memory and package. And so, we're basically buying that memory and turning around and selling it at the same price. So that's really weighing the margins down on Lunar Lake. So, margins for products are going to be under pressure pretty much throughout this year.\\nThen as Panther Lake comes in volume next year. more materially and in addition, the products beyond that, we'll start to see some improvement in margins on Intel products. Now that was always to be offset in a lot of ways by the margins of Intel foundry. We see more of a mix of EUV wafers.\\nThey have better pricing with a better cost. And so, we'll see a mixed improvement throughout the year. We're also reducing our spending there in period expenses as part of our kind of overall \\$10 billion-plus cost spending reduction. But it doesn't really show up in the first quarter.\\nIt's not until we get into the second and third quarter that we start to see that improvement show up. So those are really the bigger drivers of margins in the first quarter. It is a low point, as we talked about. The benefits are going to be really around margins improving on Intel foundry.\\nAs the mix of EU wafers increases throughout the year, in particular, as we get Panther Lake in there in the back half of the year, and we're selling 18A wafers at a higher margin. And then next year, we have Panther Lake with more volume and all those wafers start to come back, and that becomes a really big benefit to Intel overall.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question First question just on the segment guide for next quarter. Why are all three product segments down equally when it sounds like you've gotten more headwinds just on the surface of PC's inventory digestion and maybe the roll-off of some of that tariff pull forward? What's going on in the data center and the NEX businesses that makes them as bad as a client into Q1?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nWell, broadly across all markets, and we didn't necessarily telegraph every market in terms of where we think. But I'd say broadly, we're a little bit cautious on the macro and that affects all markets. In addition, seasonality does play in most of the markets, and that does impact the first quarter as well. So, I would say a combination of just macro uncertainty combined with kind of typical seasonality across all the businesses.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nStacy, do you have a follow-up question?\\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\\nYeah, I do. Thank you. So, you also talked about increased competitiveness weighing on margins at least into Q1. So again, I presume that's a question on pricing.\\nI guess, is that right? Do you expect that to persist through the year? And how do you think about that competitiveness, potentially weighing on pricing across client and especially in the data center?\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nYes, OK. So, the co-CEOs are trying to figure out who should answer OK, go ahead, Michelle.\\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\\nI think whoever wants to take it.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nYeah.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThe way I look at that is we do have increased competition as we see new market entrants particularly come into CCG. We've got a very good product in Lunar Lake there, but as Dave talked about, the margins on that product are more pressured based on the cost of the product. But we are going to stem the market segment share decline in client, and we're going to go after winning every socket. That mirrors itself when you think about the data center market as well.\\nAs I said, Granite Rapids is a very positive step in a competitive direction, but we have to stem the tide of share loss in data center. And so, we will be fighting for every socket in that business. And the way I look at it is we need to be aggressive. We need to win share, and we need to show our customers that they can win with us.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly, and our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\\nYes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question under your new co-leadership. I would be curious to hear how your strategy has potentially evolved specifically for IFS.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nI mean I think, and we've talked about this over the last couple of quarters. For one, we are not looking to spend ahead of success. And so, you saw our capex guide come down from the 20 to 23 range down to 20, that's in support of that strategy. We want to absolutely wow the customers.\\nBut to do that, we've got to be very careful around what we're promising them as well. So, I think what you'll see a lot of is a little bit more conservatism around how we deploy capital, how we engage with customers. We want to be doing more than what we promised to every turn, to every stakeholder, including investors, including customers, including suppliers, so what have you? That's pretty much the strategy. The main goal of building a world-class foundry, that's still in place.\\nWe feel that there absolutely is a need for another player in the leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing space. In particular, in the U.S., it aligns with the government the U.S. government's interest as well. So, we're absolutely committed to that.\\nIt's now about being very cautious and careful around generating the best ROIC for the shareholders.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nC.J., do you have a follow-up question?\\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\\nI do, thanks. I guess, Dave, another question for you. I believe that three months ago, the stated goal for 2025 was to be free cash flow positive, I guess, given kind of the weakness we're seeing in Q1 and uncertainty, can you kind of walk through how you're thinking about the path to turning free cash flow positive?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So, we're not obviously guiding beyond the first quarter. But I would just say, we did a very good job in a challenging situation in '24 around cash flow from operations by driving strong working capital improvements, and we adjusted capex accordingly, and that helped stem the tide. So, while we were negative in '24, we were closer to zero than we should have been based on the top line results.\\nI'd say it's more about the same in '25. We're going to be acutely focused on cash flow from operations, really managing working capital effectively. We adjusted the capex down, as I talked about in relationship to a different outlook. We do expect some pretty significant offsets as well more than \\$10 billion of offsets, which will also help.\\nI won't throw out a number yet for adjusted free cash flow for the year, but I would just say that it's a focus that where we want to improve. I would say in addition to that, we have these noncore businesses, and we see opportunity to monetize there. That will help us deliver because that's a focus of us, the focus of ours in 2025. We are far along on the process of Altera.\\nI suspect that by the time we get to earnings next quarter, we'll have something to say there that will help generate some cash that we can use to deliver.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Jonathan. Can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\\nJoe Moore -- Analyst\\nGreat, thank you. In the prepared remarks, you made reference to the sort of tempering of expectations of Falcon Shores. Can you talk about what was behind that? And kind of what does it take for you to get competitive in that space?\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, of course, I can, Joe. I think it really comes down to taking the time over the last six weeks to actively engage with the teams, look at our road maps, look at where we are from a competitive perspective and from an execution perspective, and that really resulted in that decision. A lot of conversations with my customers as well in regards to what they see is needed to be competitive and to deliver the right product. And so, when I looked at that, obviously, we have our Gaudi product, we're learning a lot from that.\\nBut one of the things that we've learned from Gaudi is it's not enough to just deliver the silicon. We need to be able to deliver a complete rack scale solution, and that's what we're going to be able to do with falcon excuse me, with Jaguar Shores. Falcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system, networking memory, all the component functions of that, but what customers really want is that full-scale rack solution. And so, we're able to get to that with Jaguar Shores.\\nI think we've also seen a lot this week with DeepSeek and a lot of the excitement around not one size fits all. And so, I'm also trying to look at the road map to say there's a lot of IP and assets that we have at Intel Product co that we can leverage to address this market. We've got great CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, FPGAs, and we need to figure out how we harness those because if we've seen anything this week, when there are constraints put on customers, they figure out different ways to deploy technology. And so that's also a great opportunity and something that I'm looking at and looking at if there's ways that we can be disruptive there.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nJoe, do you have a follow-up question?\\nJoe Moore -- Analyst\\nI do. And thank you for your candor about all of that. I think separately, you mentioned in his prepared remarks about potentially seeing tariffs driving some pull forward. Can you just talk about how pervasive that might be? Is that conservatism that, that might be happening? You're seeing evidence that's happening? Just some color on where that's coming from.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. I mean, we obviously have a fairly good sense of what customers need from quarter to quarter. And in a couple of instances, customers ordered more than we think they were digesting. And so, it was really just the analytics that gave us insight into, they're doing that for a reason, and we know tariffs are big subject of a lot of our customers.\\nIt was in the region you might expect in the Asian region that we saw this. It's hard for me to extrapolate this beyond this quarter. A lot not known yet around what might be the plans on tariffs. I just thought it was a little bit of hedging going on by customers that pulled revenue into the fourth quarter and away from the first quarter.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\\nThanks a lot. Dave, I also wanted to ask about gross margin. I think the message you were saying is that it's kind of 60% incremental, and that was kind of off of the 39.5 that you guided for Q4, but obviously, you came in, you had these one-timers and now we're down to March. So, can you just sort of level set us for kind of how to think of the incrementals from here?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nIncrementals from Q1 in other words, into Q2, 3, and 4. Is that what you're saying?\\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\\nYes. Yes. Just kind of like, is it off of 3.95%? Is it off of 3.65%.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeagh. The rule of thumb has generally been 60% in this period of what I call catch-up. Obviously, we think we can do better fall-through as we get more stabilized. The one dynamic in '25 is this kind of margin pressure around product like Lunar Lake.\\nThat probably pulls the range down to probably something more like in the 40% to 60% fall-through is probably the right way to think about it just for that dynamic. Now we get into '26 and you start to see a lot more 18A volume through Panther Lake, I think we're in the 60%-plus range at that level.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nTim, do you have a follow-up question?\\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\\nI do. Yeah, Dave, also, so you took the capex to the low end, but there's \\$1.2 billion outflow that's in the financing section of the cash flow statement. What is that? I guess I'm trying to figure out just on an apples-to-apples basis, is like capex really coming down this year? And is that a line item in the financing section, is that going to keep getting bigger this year? Thanks.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. No let's see, let me go back on the capex. If you look at capex for '25, the \\$20 billion forecast, what's driving that lower is really a function of better utilizing assets under construction. So, our philosophy has been to invest kind of ahead of what was required, and we built up a pretty significant balance in assets under construction, I mean, to the tune of greater than \\$50 billion.\\nSo, we actually have a lot of capital on the balance sheet that really hasn't been deployed. And so, what we pushed the teams to do in an effort to drive better ROA and return on invested capital is to have them digest as much as that as possible and limit the amount of purchases that we make externally. And that's going to allow us to get down to the \\$20 billion range. I would be, we're not doing any funky financing around this, but I would be in the spirit of transparency, say that capex is two things, right? It's what you place in terms of orders on equipment, and it's when you give them the cash.\\nAnd so, for sure, we are working the payment terms of suppliers to improve our -- to improve our capex, lower our capex, that is pushing spend out even as we're getting the assets in. But quite honestly, by the time we've actually deployed it and it's depreciating, we've actually, in all cases, I think, spent the money because it goes on to assets under construction and probably hangs in there for like nine months before it's ever deployed.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\\nVivek Arya -- Analyst\\nThanks for taking my question. First kind of related questions are on the data center server CPU market. MJ, I'm curious, when you look at Intel versus your x86 competitor, do you think these share gains are because of better design or access to better manufacturing? And so, what can be fixed and what will take time to fix or if you were to outsource more, right, to external foundry does that help you regain share, and I imagine that applies more to cloud. And then on the enterprise side, have you seen any share shifts at all over the last few years?\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Vivek. Well, as you look at data center and the competitiveness, as I said and stated earlier, Granite Rapids did a good job of making a good first step in closing the gap versus competition, but we still have a gap. And so, we've got to be laser-focused next on delivering diamond rapids. And the feedback for both of those products early is very positive.\\nWhen it comes to external manufacturing, I've been pretty transparent about this in the way I think about it in my philosophy. The way I look at it is you have to have the right product at the right process and you have to deliver that within the right market window. If you look at Intel's overall today, we do about 30% of our manufacturing externally across a variety of partners. That's probably the high for where we are today, but it will never be zero.\\nWhat I can tell you is 18A is going well. They earn my business, obviously, both for Panther Lake and for Clearwater Forest. But as I think about being more competitive in data center moving forward and I look at future designs, I will ask myself that question every time as we look at the road map. So, I think it would not be unfathomable that I would put a data center product outside.\\nIf that meant that I hit the right product, the right market window, as well as the right performance for my customers.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nVivek, do you have a follow-up question?\\nVivek Arya -- Analyst\\nYes. Thank you, John. So maybe one for Dave on this noncontrolling interest. I think David said \\$500 million to \\$700 million for this year, so a little bit lower than I think the \\$700 million you had before.\\nBut then it starts to grow to \\$1.2 billion or \\$1.4 billion. Is this always going to keep on increasing, right? Like what is the right way for us to model it because the less you outsource. I guess the more you insource, the more you give to a foundry, the more reversals, right, you have to do on this NCI part, I would imagine. So, is it a reasonable way to model how much of a headwind this is to your reported EPS?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, it's a good question. I mean, just to break it all out, it's more than just the SCIPs. SCIP 1 and 2 are obviously in there, but also Mobileye shows up in noncontrolling interest. And as we sell down stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera, it actually exacerbates that NCI.\\nSo, Altera doesn't have any NCI, but as soon as we sell a stake, it is going to have NCI. So, there are a number of things that go into it, which makes it a little bit difficult to forecast because you have to kind of know, you have to know two things with certainty, one, exactly what share of every asset you have? And two, what your production is going to look like in the fabs that you have these skips. So, what we felt comfortable was, was guiding guiding '25 and giving you an indication for '26, it's likely to go up in '27. But I think it's probably too soon to actually identify what the exact number will look like.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius. Your question, please.\\nBen Reitzes -- Analyst\\nDave and MJ, I wanted to, I know in your prepared remarks, you said you look forward to working with the Trump administration. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about your initial talks with them. Have they reached out? And who's like leading the discussions from your side? And any color on what you're exactly talking about and what they're particularly interested in? I mean Howard Lutnick, obviously, it sounds like this is very near and dear to him during his confirmation hearings and would love to just kind of get a little bit more color on where you, what you have done so far and where you think it's going? And then I'll have a follow-up.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. OK. Thanks, Ben. Maybe I'll take that as the co-CEO.\\nyes, we have good engagement with them. We've really been engaged since the election, with the team at various levels, obviously, at the CEO level, but also, we have a strong government affairs team that engages with them every day. I feel really good about their outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. I think this is a very positive sign, obviously, for us.\\nQuite honestly, we never left the U.S. So, we're in a kind of the pull position in that regard. And I think they understand the value of doing R&D in the U.S. for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, which also is positive.\\nThey want to see more jobs coming back to the U.S. We pay high wage, high-tech jobs. So that's obviously positive for them. But more importantly, this is about security, both in terms of just the supply chain but also in kind of secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense, which we're obviously in a position to do for them.\\nI imagine that as we progress, we'll be more engaged with them to make this a reality. And both Michelle and I will be meeting fairly regularly with the Trump administration officials to go make their goals or reality for the U.S.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nBen, you said you had a follow-up?\\nBen Reitzes -- Analyst\\nI wanted to double-click on a prior question on gross margins and ask it a little bit more in caveman terms rather than incremental. You talked about being the bottom. I'm trying to figure out how high it goes sequentially as we go throughout the year, given it sounds like you're going to be a lot more price aggressive in server CPUs and client CPUs from what I heard. So, in addition to, I'm trying to balance that with the thought of outsourcing more to TSMC for the year, etc.\\nSo, if that's the low point. I guess what I'm trying to say, can you be more prescriptive in light of that pricing comment I made and if it's right, then just give us a little more color on where we go from the 1Q, that would be great.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, I mean, we tend to be competitive in the product space. And also, as I mentioned, the cost structure is under some pressure, in particular because of Lunar Lake. So that absolutely will impact the gross margins on products. There won't be a lot of lift in that business unit through the year.\\nAnd it's really not until Panther Lake comes that they, I think, start to see some better cost structure and have a part that's very competitive that I think allows us to perhaps even relax some of that pressure in a competitive market. That said, the foundry business will see improvements. Over the course of the year, more wafers will be coming back. With Panther Lake, it becomes even better in the following year.\\nWe are improving the cost structure of the foundry business as part of our overall spending reduction plan. So, that will also help. And then just keep in mind, these wafers that we're producing at Intel and 18A have much better cost structure and margin structure relative, I should say, relative to the price structure than their predecessors and that will be beneficial on the foundry side. So, in the caveman macro sense, I think the best thing to do is probably take this like somewhere in the 40% to 60% fall-through and that's probably the right rough-order math to get you to where the margins will go in any quarter based on what you're projecting the revenue to be in that quarter.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\\nOperator\\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to build off of that last question a little bit. During the prepared remarks, you had mentioned 1% in 2023 with EUV wafer mix and that progressed to north of 5% this year. Can you give us a framework of how you would define success looking through 2025, maybe exiting the year as far as EUV wafer mix? And remind us again what the delta is in terms of cost structure, the margin dynamics of an EUV wafer.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Well, I'll say on the second part, maybe I'll answer that one first. I would say the price on those wafers goes up at 3x the cost of those -- sorry, maybe said, the blended ASP and cost goes up 3x as you go to 18A versus the cost. So, it's a pretty dramatic improvement in gross margins as you move into 18A versus pre-EUV wafers.\\nProbably, it'd be tough for me to hazard a guess on exactly how we'll exit the year in terms of our percentage of EUV. It's definitely going to go up. You know branded is on Intel 3, Panther Lake is on Meteor Lake is on Intel 3 or 4, 4 and 3 node. Panther Lake is on 18A this year.\\nSo, we'll see a pretty meaningful jump in the percentage of wafers that will be EUV as we exit '25.\\nRoss Seymore -- Analyst\\nAaron, do we have a follow-up question?\\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\\nI do, and it's probably a dumb question, but I'm just going to ask it because I'm just a little confused that the SCIP impact, this \\$500 million to \\$700 million going to \\$1.2 billion. Just remind us again, so we're all clear that when you report EPS on a non-GAAP basis, that's in that EPS number, just so we -- I'm modeling it correctly. I'm sure my peers are already, but I want to make sure I've got that all clear in my head.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nI just want to be clear. It's not just SCIP. I mean that includes the Mobileye income and will include the Altera income to some extent. But yes, all of that in the NCI, we do take it against our non-GAAP number to get our fully diluted non-GAAP EPS number.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nAaron, thank you. Jonathan, we have time for one more question.\\nOperator\\nCertainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\\nSrini Pajjuri -- Analyst\\nThank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, on the foundry breakeven, I guess, target for 2027. Maybe can you talk about what are the assumptions behind that? I mean do you think you can get there with mostly internal wafers? Or do you need external customers as well? If so, what sort of revenue do we need from external customers to, I guess, achieve that breakeven?\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So, we're still aiming to get to breakeven in 2017, as you pointed out. It's really on the back of internal wafers or wafers from Intel products, I should say. And it's obviously, a lot based on EUV wafers, which carry a better margin.\\nAnd as that mix improves, that significantly improves the margins. But more importantly, I think the original premise by creating this different P&L structure was to drive the foundry business really at that point was just a function of manufacturing to be more focused on efficiency, to squeeze out more from the existing footprint, to be more sensitive to capital and ultimately, just think about ROIC in everything they do, and I think that has worked actually. I mean I hear it all the time. It's amazing the transformation we've seen in staff meetings, and Michelle and I attended that, they're completely pivoted to how to make money in that business.\\nAnd so, I think it's working. I think we'll see significantly more efficiency as we go into work through '25 and into '26. So, I feel good about our ability to get to breakeven. Obviously, we want to have external customers.\\nAnd so, we have some very small amount that we've assumed for '27. But if 18A looks like it's something that hunts based on feedback from customers. And I feel like we will probably outperform in that regard in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers. So those are all the factors that I think will drive '27 to profitability.\\nAnd ultimately, obviously, we want to get to push to breakeven and ultimately, we want to get the business to a profitable level that's consistent with what the foundry industry gets.\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nSrini, do you have a quick follow-on?\\nSrini Pajjuri -- Analyst\\nYes. A quick one. So, on the 18A Panther Lake, I think in the past, I think, Dave, the comment was that you expect to bring roughly 70% of the die in-house. Is that still the plan? And then is it pretty set in stone that you're bringing it back for sure? Or do you have any flexibility whether to bring back more of the die or less of the die if you need to.\\nSo just trying to understand.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nI'm going to let Michelle answer that because it really is her decision on how she builds her products.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. So, we did move Panther Lake inside of 18A design win. But as I stated before, we look at each generation of products based on what's the right product, what's the right process, what's the right market window and what allows our customers to win. So, for Panther Lake, that was 18A.\\nAnd as I said, we're very happy with where we are from a performance and yield perspective at this point in the process. So, that will stay on 18A. Then as you look forward, to our next-generation product for client after that, Nova Lake will actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So, you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside.\\nAgain, it's about optimizing to what allows us to win in the market, what allows us to win with our customers and optimizing the overall product portfolio because at the end of the day, if our customers are successful, we win, that drives more wafers and Intel foundry and that allows us to win, but I'll continue to have a balance. And as I said, we'll be doing the same look across our data center portfolio as well.\\nDavid A. Zinsner -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\\nGreat. Thanks, Michelle. So, with that, let me wrap up by saying thank you, as always, for joining the call. MJ and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress and the actions we've taken.\\nQ4 was a good step forward, obviously, but we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, and we're looking forward to updating you as we go along. We hope to see many of you in person at the investors conferences we'll be attending in Q1. And I'd also like to highlight that the Intel foundry team will be hosting their second annual Direct Connect User event on April 29th in San Jose, and we hope many of you will join that in person. So, thank you, and good night.\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\nDuration: 0 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nJohn Pitzer -- Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations\\nMichelle Holthaus -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer\\nDavid A.
